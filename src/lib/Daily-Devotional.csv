01-01,01-01,1,"Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was excellent in every way. This all happened on the sixth day. ",Genesis 1:31,"The opening chapters of the Old and New Testaments bring to the forefront two couples: Adam and Eve in the Old Testament and Mary and Joseph in the New. Their stories emphasize the concepts of family and community. Adam and Eve were created to enjoy each other as husband and wife. Their family was in community with God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Sin had not yet broken this beautiful fellowship between man and wife and God and humanity.

Soon, however, sin did enter the world, but Mary and Joseph’s family began the restoration of the human race back to God. In their community, God placed His Son Jesus to restore God’s fellowship to humanity (community) and humanity’s fellowship with one another (family). Nothing was wrong with God’s original plan—it was \“excellent in every way\” (Genesis 1:31).

Let us start this year by asking the Lord to restore to us our fellowship with Him in any area that has been broken by sin. Then let us ask Him to restore family in relationships with others whom we have offended. Jesus came to bring us back to God’s original plan!"
01-02,01-02,2,"From now on, you and the woman will be enemies, and your offspring and her offspring will be enemies. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel. ",Genesis 3:15,"From the moment God promised the devil that Eve’s offspring would crush his head, Satan sought to murder the Messiah. John 8:44 tells us that “he was a murderer from the beginning and has always hated the truth.” The spirit of murder is of the devil.

Thinking that perhaps Abel was the Messiah, Satan incited Cain to murder his brother. Later, when he realized that Jesus was the true Messiah, he provoked the bloodthirsty tyrant Herod into killing “all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, because the wise men had told him the star first appeared to them about two years earlier” (Matthew 2:16).

Satan’s hatred, not only for Christ but also for those who are “Christ-ians,” has driven him to murder millions of believers worldwide. Try as he will, though, to gather those who will “plot together against the Lord and against his anointed one” (Psalm 2:2), the devil is always defeated! In fact, God even laughs at Satan’s anger and murderous attempts to stop His Son from redeeming the world (v. 4).

In the end, the ultimate prophecy to believers will be fulfilled: “Only ask, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, the ends of the earth as your possession” (v. 8). We are on the winning side!"
01-03,01-03,3,"But you, O Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts my head high. ",Psalm 3:3,"Even as a child, David recognized God’s divine shield of protection around him. He felt so safe when surrounded by his enemies that he could actually lie down and sleep. God has always protected His children and made a way of escape for those He loves (1 Corinthians 10:13).

Genesis 6 describes another example of God’s protection, relating how He saved Noah’s family from the raging waters of destruction that He had sent to cleanse the earth. Later on, in Genesis 19, the Lord delivered Lot and his family out of the city of Sodom just moments before He destroyed it with fire and brimstone.

Christ found the way of escape from temptation in the wilderness when Satan came on three separate occasions with his most subtle deceptions. Each time Jesus escaped from the snare by quoting the Word of God.

In times of trouble, remember, as did Noah and his family, that the raging waters and winds outside your “ark” pose no threat. You are safe and dry inside the refuge of God. Let the winds blow, the heathen rage, and the enemy rise up. God’s angels will protect and deliver you in the midst of any storm!"
01-04,01-04,4,"They immediately followed him, leaving the boat and their father behind. ",Matthew 4:22,"Something about the comfort and safety of the boat makes it hard to leave! After Noah had floated in the ark for months, God caused the floodwaters to recede and directed Noah and his family to leave their haven of refuge. Surely Noah wondered what it would be like outside the ark.

Peter, too, knew the safety of the boat. But one day Jesus challenged him to leave the known and enter the unknown realm of “fishing for men.” Can’t you just imagine how Peter must have felt? What would it be like to wake up every day and follow Jesus? he must have thought.

The boat represents old habits, securities, and ways of doing things. Peter had been a fisherman for years; Noah had been confined to the security of the ark for months. Both had to decide if they would dare to follow the One who called them. When Noah sent the dove out the second time and it did not return to him (Genesis 8:12), he knew it was time to leave the ark. Like the dove, he had no desire to stay in his world of former security. When Peter heard the voice of the Master, he knew it was time to leave the place of family refuge and follow the will of God.

Once you have tasted of a new world—a world of ministry—you will have no desire to return to the mundane routine of life. Leave the boat, my Christian friend. A new world awaits you!"
01-05,01-05,5,Let’s build a great city with a tower that reaches to the skies—a monument to our greatness! This will bring us together and keep us from scattering all over the world. ,Genesis 11:4,"On the plain of Shinar, the people decided to make a name for themselves by building a great tower. Their example shows the powerful forces of self-exaltation at work within the human race. God cannot share His glory, however, and will intentionally bring to naught any plan or project that overly exalts the name of humankind.

The opposite of such an exalted spirit can be seen in Abraham’s life. Abraham, a lowly Aramaean, became the father of faith for all time. God promised him, “I will cause you to become the father of a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous, and I will make you a blessing to others” (Genesis 12:2). Subsequent passages show how Abraham’s simple, childlike obedience repeatedly attracted God’s favor. He rose to higher and higher planes of honor by placing his faith solely in God.

Jesus said in Matthew 5:3, “God blesses those who realize their need for him, for the Kingdom of Heaven is given to them.” In verse 5 He says, “God blesses those who are gentle and lowly, for the whole earth will belong to them.” What a contrast these attitudes are to those of the arrogant tower builders who tried to control the earth through their aggressiveness!

The psalmist said, “With deepest awe I will worship at your Temple” (Psalm 5:7). A temple, not a tower, is what we are building, and all its glory belongs to God, not to us!"
01-06,01-06,6,"Afterward the Lord spoke to Abram in a vision and said to him, “Do not be afraid, Abram, for I will protect you, and your reward will be great.” ",Genesis 15:1,"God knew that people would battle two major enemies: pride and selfishness. He dealt with humanity’s pride at Babel (Genesis 11:1-9), and in Genesis 14 He dealt with humanity’s selfishness.

Abraham was the first man recorded in the Scriptures to tithe, although Abel did offer the Lord “choice lambs from the best of his flock” (Genesis 4:4). Abraham’s worship of God with ten percent of his revenue showed that he acknowledged his financial responsibility before God and knew that God, in turn, would take care of his needs. By refusing the king of Sodom’s reward (Genesis 14:21-23), Abraham rejected the world’s system. God became his reward (his salary, wages, and compensation), and God, in turn, recompensed Abraham with something that money could not buy: a child!

Tithing was a sign of Abraham’s covenant with God. God reciprocated and pledged all His assets to Abraham, even unto the fourth generation (Genesis 15:14-16). Abraham further exemplified an unselfish spirit when he gave Lot the first choice of where to live. The final result was that Abraham profited much more than Lot because he obeyed the principle of unselfish sacrifice for others (Genesis 13).

Want to be blessed? Be a tither!"
01-07,01-07,7,"But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father secretly. ",Matthew 6:6,"The importance of patience in prayer and in life cannot be overemphasized! Abraham lived most of his life patiently believing that God would fulfill His promise to give him a son. In his old age, however, he succumbed to pressure from his wife to have a child by her maid, Hagar (Genesis 16:2). Abraham hearkened to the voice of his wife instead of giving her godly direction—a choice that proved to be a historic mistake.

Ishmael has come to symbolize the fruit of impatience. When you do not believe that God has heard your cry in prayer, you take matters into your own hands and create situations that you cannot successfully bring to a close. If you truly believe that your Father has seen you and heard your prayer, why struggle to come up with your own solution? Boldly assert as did Hagar, “I have seen the One who sees me!” (Genesis 16:13).

Isaac means “laughter,” so you may as well keep laughing until your “Isaac” shows up. Ishmaels come quickly, but they never go away."
01-08,01-08,8,"You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose the easy way. But the gateway to life is small, and the road is narrow, and only a few ever find it. ",Matthew 7:13-14,"
The story of Lot is a chronicle of the search for the “wide gate,” symbolizing the luxuries and pleasures of the world. Lot’s eyes were distracted from purity by viewing the pastures of the well-watered plain of Sodom. From living in the valley, to pitching his tent near Sodom, to living in the city, to city rulership in the gate of Sodom— the pitiful progression of distraction continued.

How easy it is to fall deeper and deeper into the lure of the world! “Everybody’s doing it” is a statement from a person sure to be heading down the broad way that leads to destruction. Satan’s payoff for Lot’s compromise was to give him a cave instead of a castle, incestuous daughters instead of his wife, poverty instead of position.

The opposite was true of Abraham, who chose the “narrow gate.” His unswerving desire to please God resulted in his gaining favor with God. He was a part of the chosen few, and his intercession with God for Lot is a classic example of his reward.

Stay in the “narrow way.” Neither you nor your children will ever regret it.

"
01-09,01-09,9,"Anyone who listens to my teaching and obeys me is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. ",Matthew 7:24,"Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac represents a faith that acts, not one that just talks. Anyone can say, “I trust the Lord,” but raising a knife to one’s most precious possession is proof of real faith.

It is not enough to only hear the commandments of God—we must do them. James said, “Fool! When will you ever learn that faith that does not result in good deeds is useless?” (James 2:20). There comes a moment in our lives when we must translate talk into an action that demonstrates the reality of our faith.

As Abraham climbed the mountain of Moriah, his faith gave energy to his actions. In his mind he had reckoned that God was able to raise up Isaac, even if he died (Hebrews 11:19). Abraham’s faith risked all and lost nothing.

Let’s step out in obedience. When we do, God will have the ram waiting in the thicket!"
01-10,01-10,10,"Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will direct your paths. ",Proverbs 3:5-6,"When Abraham was old, he grew anxious for Isaac, his son and heir, to marry a girl from his own clan from the region where he’d been raised. He certainly didn’t want Isaac to marry an ungodly Canaanite! So Abraham sent a trusted servant to find a wife for Isaac. The servant posed a legitimate question: How could he travel a thousand miles to an unknown region and find just the right bride for his master?

To his everlasting credit, this servant was wise enough to commit his nearly impossible mission to God’s direction. The miraculous result was that out of all the cities, all the wells, and all the girls in the land of the East, Rebekah came out to the well. The servant’s secret to success was in committing his journey to God’s providence.

If God has the hairs of your head numbered (Matthew 10:30), He can surely do a better job of running your life than you can. If you lean upon your own understanding, you face an endless, impossible task. But God, who is infinite in understanding, can quickly bring a positive solution to the assignment.

The servant reported to Abraham, saying, “Before I had finished praying these words, I saw Rebekah” (Genesis 24:45). Pray, commit, and watch. Your answer may already be there."
01-11,01-11,11,Then Rebekah and her servants mounted the camels and left with Abraham’s servant. ,Genesis 24:61,"Rebekah’s journey to meet Isaac is an inspiring lesson in devotion to the unseen. Although she had never seen Isaac, Rebekah willingly separated from her family for life. There was no courtship, no “trial period,” and no way home! A thousand-mile camel ride stood between her family and her decision to marry Isaac.

As though leaving her family was not enough, Rebekah embarked on one of the roughest journeys a bride could ever face, involving weeks of camelback travel over harsh desert terrain. All her endurance was based upon the servant’s description of Isaac. No wonder Isaac’s heart was filled with love for this bride when he saw the camels approaching (Genesis 24:63-67)!

In the same way, Jesus is looking for His Bride. He is looking for a Church that is willing to separate forever from its family and follow after Him. His Church must be able to endure hardship on its journey through the desert of life. The Church presses on toward heaven with one motive: devotion to Jesus.

Get on your camel one more time, for this may be the day you see your long-awaited Bridegroom!"
01-12,01-12,12,"Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything your land produces. Then he will fill your barns with grain, and your vats will overflow with the finest wine. ",Proverbs 3:9-10,"Isaac was a man whose life demonstrated the blessing of God. He was undoubtedly a tithing believer and a successful farmer, as were his father Abraham and son Jacob. Genesis 26:12 tells us, “That year Isaac’s crops were tremendous! He harvested a hundred times more grain than he planted, for the Lord blessed him.” While others were perishing in the famine, Isaac sowed in the land and reaped a hundredfold return.

It was Isaac’s attitude, however, that brought the blessing of God. When he had dug a “gushing spring” (Genesis 26:19), the shepherds of Gerar came and stole it from him. Instead of quarreling, he moved on and “dug another well” (v. 21). When that new well was stolen, “he dug another well” (v. 22). Finally his well was not stolen, and the Lord said to him, “Do not be afraid, for I am with you and will bless you” (v. 24).

Attitudes of bitterness, anger, resentment, and strife will keep you from financial blessing. Dig another well, keep your heart right, and God will pour out even more blessings than before!"
01-13,01-13,13,"But the Lord is in his holy Temple; the Lord still rules from heaven. He watches everything closely, examining everyone on earth. ",Psalm 11:4,"Poor Jacob thought his trickery of his father had gone unnoticed. He forgot that God was watching everything and everybody—including him! Someone said, “You may get by, but you won’t get away!” Little did Jacob know that God would discipline him by preparing someone even trickier than he to enter his life. “My child, don’t ignore it when the Lord disciplines you, and don’t be discouraged when he corrects you. For the Lord corrects those he loves. . . .”(Proverbs 3:11-12).

For seven long years Jacob served Laban for his daughter Rachel. Then, on the wedding night, Laban tricked him into marrying Leah. It is interesting that Jacob deceived his father in a tent, and later he himself was deceived in a tent! God will discipline you with the exact process you used on someone else. God loved Jacob and knew that until he met a superior deceiver, he would be tricking, deceiving, and supplanting for the rest of his life.

Do not despise the Lord’s work in your life. He loves you, and His discipline will yield “a quiet harvest of right living” (Hebrews 12:11)."
01-14,01-14,14,"The Lord’s promises are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over. ",Psalm 12:6,"One word from God can completely revolutionize your life. Jacob received one such word in Genesis 31:10-12, when God instructed him concerning the “streaked, speckled, and spotted” sheep. With that one word, Jacob developed a specific process of breeding the sheep that gradually converted the entire flock to his ownership!

God sees the dilemma you are in, whether it’s with an oppressive employer, a difficult marriage partner, or some other strained relationship. He can give you one word of wisdom that will completely change your situation. We call this word revelation. Through dreams and visions, the Holy Spirit communicates to your mind something that is in the mind of God. In Jacob’s case, it made no sense to put peeled rods in front of sheep, but he did it anyway. His obedience to that word from God brought him much success and wealth (Genesis 30:43).

Such is the miracle of God’s Word. It may seem ridiculous to the natural mind, but God’s Word works. You must wait upon Him to receive that Word, and then keep it before your eyes daily, just as Jacob placed the rods before his sheep."
01-15,01-15,15,Your enemies will be right in your own household! ,Matthew 10:36,"Jesus taught us that serving God might prove costly in family relationships. Jacob learned that painful lesson when his close family became the immediate source of his greatest problems. His father-in-law Laban cheated him, tricked him, abused him, and even chased him when he left (Genesis 31:23). In another instance, Jacob’s brother Esau appeared to be angry to the point of revenge when he came to meet Jacob with his four hundred men. The outcome in both these situations? God intervened on Jacob’s behalf! Laban was rebuked in a dream: “Be careful about what you say to Jacob!” Esau received Jacob back with tears and kisses (Genesis 33:4).

Jesus told His disciples to decide whether they loved Him or their relatives more. Because the time may come when a relative departs from the Lord’s way, we, too, must choose to follow the “narrow way.” This doesn’t mean that we intentionally ostracize our relatives, only that we are fully prepared to be rejected or misunderstood by them.

God helped Jacob with both Laban and Esau. If you are having a family conflict, He will help you through it as well!"
01-16,01-16,16,"But Jacob panted, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” ",Genesis 32:26,"When Jacob wrestled with the angel at Peniel, the angel tried to overpower him. He knew that unless he could break Jacob’s stubborn and deceptive will, Jacob would never attain greatness in God.

Jesus told His disciples in Matthew 11:29, “Take my yoke upon you,” an obvious statement of learning the “rest” of submission. You will not go very far with God until you allow Him to subdue your drive, energies, ambitions, and passions. When He wins that battle over you, the “rest” of God will follow.

Later in Jacob’s struggle, he held on to the angel of the Lord, forcefully pressing in for a blessing from the One who had subdued him. Jesus told His disciples that “the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing, and violent people attack it” (Matthew 11:12).

God wants you to rest in your flesh and be forceful in your spirit! That balance changed Jacob from a trickster to a prince with God."
01-17,01-17,17,"Who may worship in your sanctuary, Lord? Who may enter your presence on your holy hill? Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right, speaking the truth from sincere hearts. ",Psalm 15:1-2,"The lessons of purity and holiness are simple: tell the truth, speak no gossip, honor the righteous, keep your word, be generous with others, and accept no bribes. These simple commandments address the way we relate to our fellow man. Yet who among us has not broken these simple guidelines and does not need to repent?

God is so merciful, even with the likes of us. Despite all Jacob’s transgressions, when he relinquished his foreign gods, the Lord met him and was merciful to him (Genesis 35:2, 9). Jesus told the Pharisees, “I want you to be merciful; I don’t want your sacrifices” (Matthew 12:7). He reminded them of the value of one human being. Because Jesus is compassionate, He “will not crush those who are weak, or quench the smallest hope, until he brings full justice with his final victory” (v. 20).

Like Jacob, we all “fall short of God’s glorious standard” (Romans 3:23), and God patiently works with us to restore us into His presence. If sin has knocked you off God’s holy hill, get up, repent, and climb it again. You will find a merciful Lord at the top, greeting you with open arms!"
01-18,01-18,18,"Stop judging others, and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. ",Matthew 7:1-2,"How quick we are to judge something or someone with a standard we cannot live up to ourselves. When Judah discovered his daughter-in-law’s prostitution, his first reaction was “Bring her out and burn her!” (Genesis 38:24). The problem he failed to realize was that he was the one who had hired her as a prostitute!

When Nathan told David a story about a poor man who had only one sheep that was stolen by a man who had many sheep, David was enraged. “As surely as the Lord lives,” he vowed, “any man who would do such a thing deserves to die!” (2 Samuel 12:5). Verse 7 says, “Then Nathan said to David, ‘You are that man!’ ”

The Pharisees wrongly judged Jesus Christ when they said He cast out devils by the devil. Jesus asked them, “And if I am empowered by the prince of demons, what about your own followers? They cast out demons, too, so they will judge you for what you have said” (Matthew 12:27).

Jesus taught His disciples that they would be judged by the same standard with which they judged others (Matthew 7:2). It’s hard to remove a splinter from someone else’s eye when there is a log in your own!"
01-19,01-19,19,"You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing amiss, for I am determined not to sin in what I say. ",Psalm 17:3,"Everyone goes through a process of proving and testing. Jesus taught that the seed falls on various types of ground, each type representing the human heart (Matthew 13). Each of us will be tested to see how well we battle the areas of unbelief, discouragement, and distraction.

The birds mentioned in Matthew 13:4 are the demonic thieves who lie to us about the promises of God, tricking us into unbelief. The rocky soil (vv. 20-21) represents the onslaught of discouraging problems and persecutions that come our way. The thorny ground (v. 22) refers to the continual distractions of riches, pleasure, and worldly things.

Joseph passed each test in his thirteen years of Egyptian captivity. Throughout those years, he never allowed himself to doubt or to become negative about God’s promise that he would one day be a ruler. He also never grew discouraged, though his way grew more difficult. Finally, he never compromised with sin, even when Potiphar’s wife offered him everything in exchange for his purity.

Decide today to reject unbelief, to fight discouragement, and to refuse the distractions of the world. As you pass God’s tests in each of these areas, He will take you from the pit to the prison to the palace!"
01-20,01-20,20,"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but it becomes the largest of garden plants and grows into a tree where birds can come and find shelter in its branches. ",Matthew 13:31-32,"From a tiny seed comes a mighty tree that provides shade and refuge for the animals of the world. In the same way, the Kingdom of God spreads from small and insignificant beginnings.

Joseph is an example of such a seed. From one solitary life, the Holy Spirit provided a huge and fruitful tree that brought life to the world. Under Joseph’s direction during the seven years of plenty, “the granaries were filled to overflowing” (Genesis 41:49). During the time of famine, people came from many lands for the provision Joseph had stored (Genesis 41:56-57).

God desires to bless you, like He did Joseph, with an abundance to be put into a storehouse for others. Such abundance represents your overflow finances, seed that God will place in your hands to bless the world. Be faithful, prepare a storehouse bank account for missions, and ask God for seed. He will turn your “mustard seed” into a mighty tree for the nations!"
01-21,01-21,21,"He makes me as surefooted as a deer, leading me safely along the mountain heights. ",Psalm 18:33,"The deer is an interesting animal with incredible characteristics regarding balance. When suddenly knocked from a high, rocky crag, the deer always lands on its feet and scampers right back up to the place from which it fell.

David said in verse 16 of Psalm 18, “He reached down from heaven and rescued me; he drew me out of deep waters.” Time and time again, David’s kingdom was attacked by Saul, Goliath, and countless armies of enemies. Each time, however, he managed to land securely and to climb right back up to prominence. Why? Because instead of leading David on a treacherous, narrow path, God widened the path beneath his feet “to keep them from slipping” (v. 36).

Being spiritual does not make you immune from attack, but the Lord will prepare you for any battle (Psalm 18:34). When the enemy comes against you, you can “crush an army” and “scale any wall” (v. 29). Don’t lie down and wallow in self-pity when attacked, but stand up like the deer and scamper back up to the top!"
01-22,01-22,22,"Don’t worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours. ",Genesis 45:20,"Joseph instructed his brothers to let their father know that he could totally disregard his own possessions and move to Egypt. It was ridiculous to worry about some old, beat-up tents and provisions when Joseph was ruler of Egypt. Huge cartloads of provision and clothing followed the brothers as they returned to Israel. There was no more need for stinginess or financial worry.  Their brother Joseph was providing for all their needs from the wealth of Egypt.

So often we cling to our few, tiny resources when in reality the wealth of heaven belongs to us. One little boy was willing to give up his five pieces of bread and two fish to the Master. His obedience was not a sacrifice, for the Lord not only gave him back his lunch, but He also provided twelve baskets of leftovers to take home (Matthew 14:20)! Those small objects given in obedience were the key that unlocked the wheat fields and oceans of Israel.

Provision is normal when you realize that you have a “relative” who occupies a very important position in the universe. Your brother Jesus—not Pharaoh—sits at the right hand of God! How much more should you be confident about giving up your meager belongings on earth?"
01-23,01-23,23,The sun lives in the heavens where God placed it. It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding. It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race. ,Psalm 19:4-5,"Fierce, fiery, and faithful, the sun never wavers from its course, which is set by the Word of God. Neither does it waver because of weather conditions. The only time the sun ever stopped was when Joshua commanded it to obey the Word of the Lord (Joshua 10:12-13)!

The spiritual “sky” is full of spiritual “suns.” They are champions and never waver while running their courses. The woman of Tyre and Sidon was such a champion. She refused to be put off or denied the deliverance of her daughter (Matthew 15:21-28). Her face was set like a flint, like a champion runner in the race of his life.

Joseph, too, was such a champion. His faithful resolution to God’s Word and promise resulted not only in his personal salvation and the feeding of the world but also in his family’s salvation and deliverance.

“The way of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, which shines ever brighter until the full light of day” (Proverbs 4:18). Shine on, brothers and sisters! You are champions, and you will finish your courses with joy!"
01-24,01-24,24,"Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May God, the God before whom my grandfather Abraham and my father, Isaac, walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life, and the angel who has kept me from all harm— may he bless these boys. May they preserve my name and the names of my grandfather Abraham and my father, Isaac. And may they become a mighty nation.” ",Genesis 48:15-16,"Israel’s blessings started with the word may. As Jacob laid his hands upon the heads of Ephraim and Manasseh, he uttered the word and invoked a blessing with it three times.

The psalmist blessed Israel with equal force: “May the Lord respond to your cry. May the God of Israel keep you safe. . . . May he send you help. . . . May he remember all your gifts. . . . May he grant your heart’s desire and fulfill all your plans. May we shout for joy when we hear of your victory. . . . May the Lord answer all your prayers” (Psalm 20:1-5).

The word may could be translated “allow.” In other words, allow God to do what He wants to do for you. You must settle in your mind forever that God wants to bless you. Any doubt will always result in questioning His desire to answer your prayers or to increase, deliver, and help you.

God’s Word has the same power to bless you, as did Jacob’s words for his grandsons. “Pay attention, my child, to what I say. Listen carefully. Don’t lose sight of my words. Let them penetrate deep within your heart, for they bring life and radiant health to anyone who discovers their meaning” (Proverbs 4:20-22).

May the Lord bless you today!"
01-25,01-25,25,"As far as I am concerned, God turned into good what you meant for evil. ",Genesis 50:20,"How marvelously God turns everything around for His glory and purposes! Through all his years of suffering and difficulty, Joseph refused to become bitter. His brothers—the means through which his suffering had come—could have been prime targets for Joseph’s blame. But Joseph didn’t play the blame game. What a class act! Joseph’s wisdom gave him the perspective to see God’s work, not the devil’s, in and through his life.

Paul reminds us in Romans 8:28 that “God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.” God even turned around Pharaoh’s terrible actions of destroying babies so that Moses could be brought to Pharaoh’s daughter!

There is nothing Satan does that will not turn around on him. God will not be defeated or outwitted. Trust Him, refuse to become bitter, and watch Him turn your situation around for good!"
01-26,01-26,26,"Go down to the lake and throw in a line. Open the mouth of the first fish you catch, and you will find a coin. Take the coin and pay the tax for both of us. ",Matthew 17:27,"Would you have faith to fish for your tax money? Jesus received a word from God that somewhere down in the depths of the Sea of Galilee was a most unusual fish. This unique and special fish, different from all the others, was going to be a source of unusual blessing.

Our faith is often limited by expecting natural sources of blessing rather than believing for supernatural blessing. Faith, however, was a normal way of life for Jesus. He never flinched when telling His disciples that if they had faith “as small as a mustard seed,” [they] “could say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it would move” (Matthew 17:20). He didn’t hesitate to rebuke His disciples when their faith failed to deliver a young boy suffering from seizures.

Having faith does not mean that we will not use natural means to pay our bills or to be delivered. However, our faith must be based upon the knowledge that God is the One working behind the scenes of our lives, preparing provision before we need it.

If you need a miracle, look around every corner . . . and be sure you look in every fish’s mouth!"
01-27,01-27,27,"For where two or three gather together because they are mine, I am there among them. ",Matthew 18:20,"Moses and Aaron formed a divine partnership before Pharaoh. By himself, Moses felt weak and incapable. That’s why the Lord sent him a prayer partner in Aaron. For the next four decades, these two men walked together doing great exploits for God.

“How could one person chase a thousand of them, and two people put ten thousand to flight . . . unless the Lord had given them up?” (Deuteronomy 32:30). Two people who are partners are five times more powerful than two individuals acting alone! Moses and Aaron did not realize how much they would need each other until after their first round with Pharaoh. Not only did Pharaoh reject them, but also their own people rejected them.

Solomon said, “Two people can accomplish more than twice as much as one; they get a better return for their labor. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But people who are alone when they fall are in real trouble” (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10).

It is a scientific fact that geese flying in a flock honk to encourage each other. Moses needed a “honker” in Aaron, and you, too, need others to support you. Find your two or three “honkers,” and take on the “Pharaoh” in your life!"
01-28,01-28,28,"You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You welcome me as a guest, anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings. ",Psalm 23:5,"Moses and Aaron stood with great confidence before Pharaoh and declared the Lordship of God. Then, with only a rod, Moses systematically dismantled Egypt. He took the offensive, not the defensive, and began demonstrating to Pharaoh who “I am the Lord” (Exodus 6:2) truly was. The rod and staff of God comforted Moses as he stood and watched God transform his staff into a snake and turn the Nile into blood.

Without armies and guns, diplomacy and politics, or cleverness and reason, Moses prevailed by maintaining a relaxed anointing. As your enemies rant and rave, they do not understand how you can sit so relaxed at the table of the Lord. While they are delivering their tirade in the power of the flesh, you sit in the power of the anointing. You must learn that as you “walk through the dark valley of death” (Psalm 23:4), there is truly nothing to fear.

Relax and lie down in green pastures. God will fight “Pharaoh” while you feed at the table of the Lord."
01-29,01-29,29,"The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it. The world and all its people belong to him. ",Psalm 24:1,"In quick succession, the gods of Egypt were challenged and defeated. Starting with the Nile (the Egyptians’ primary deity), then following with the sun and the cattle, all Egypt’s false gods were symbolically destroyed. The point of these ten plagues was to reveal that the “earth belongs to the Lord” (Exodus 9:29). God will share His glory with neither empires nor individuals. The hardening of Pharaoh’s heart caused him to provide a setting by which God could gain a name for Himself.

David also came to the realization that “the earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it” (Psalm 24:1). He continued the thought, saying, “Who is the King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, invincible in battle” (v. 8).

The earth is a battleground where God displays His victory over Satan. Satan may be “the god of this evil world” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but the earth belongs to God. So claim nations as your inheritance, and challenge every god that lays claim to what God has created!"
01-30,01-30,30,"For even I, the Son of Man, came here not to be served but to serve others, and to give my life as a ransom for many. ",Matthew 20:28,"Without contradiction, we can say that Christ came to earth to die. From the beginning of His ministry, Jesus instructed His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him. He told them that unless they ate His flesh and drank His blood, they had no life in them.

Moses’ revelation of the blood is described in Exodus 12:13: “The blood you have smeared on your doorposts will serve as a sign. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. This plague of death will not touch you when I strike the land of Egypt.” The blood of an innocent, meek lamb would substitute for an entire household. Although the firstborn of Israel deserved death just as much as did Pharaoh’s firstborn, the blood of the lamb ransomed (paid for, bought back) their lives.

Like that lamb, Christ was a gentle, humble servant who never sought the glory and exaltation for which the disciples were constantly striving. In humility, never forget Christianity’s focus: we deserve to die, but Christ, the spotless Lamb, died in our place—the “just for the unjust” (1 Peter 3:18 KJV). Rejoice today in the power of the blood of Jesus who ransomed you from death!"
01-31,01-31,31,"O God, ransom Israel from all its troubles. ",Psalm 25:22,"Oh, how great was the redemption that God accomplished for Israel on that night of deliverance! First, they were delivered from death. In like manner, we, too, have been delivered from eternal death—spared from hell and from being cut off from God forever.

Next, they were redeemed from sickness. Psalm 105:37 says that “there were no sick or feeble people among them,” even after many years of hard labor! In the same way, Christ paid for our healing, for we “have been healed by his wounds” (1 Peter 2:24).

Then the Israelites were redeemed from poverty. Overnight they went from being paupers to being prosperous when they “asked the Egyptians for clothing and articles of silver and gold” (Exodus 12:35). The Lord gave them favor and the Egyptians granted their request, providing them with all they needed in order to live in the wilderness and to build a glorious tabernacle for the Lord.

We can claim a full inheritance of provision for any need we have to advance the glory of God. Our redemption was not paid for with the blood of bulls and goats, but with the precious blood of Christ!"
02-01,02-01,32,"Anyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone on whom it falls. ",Matthew 21:44,"Two options are available in God’s kingdom program: Get with the program, or get run over by the program! The Lord is long-suffering, patient, and kind, but the end result of a willful rebellion against Him is destruction.

The contrast between Pharaoh and Moses is an exact picture of Jesus’ parable in Matthew 21:44. Pharaoh was a powerful, proud, and self-centered leader whose iron will is well documented in biblical history, but Moses was a broken man. Moses was the meekest man on earth—one who had been tamed by his many years of humble service with sheep. He had tried to deliver Israel by himself, yet failed. Failure brought brokenness, and brokenness brought meekness.

Pharaoh, on the other hand, refused to be broken before God. He repeatedly hardened his heart and was eventually led into the waters of the Red Sea. There he was crushed by the falling stone of God’s justice. Break or be broken was the choice, and Pharaoh unwisely chose the latter. As the bodies of dead soldiers washed upon the sand, the message was clear: “The Lord will reign forever and ever!” (Exodus 15:18)."
02-02,02-02,33,"When they came to Marah, they finally found water. But the people couldn’t drink it because it was bitter. (That is why the place was called Marah, which means “bitter.”) ",Exodus 15:23,"We know from the biblical account of Israel’s exodus from Egypt that Moses grew weary of the Israelites’ constant grumbling. Though they experienced many miracles on their wilderness journey, distasteful experiences and feelings of being robbed or cheated had left them bitter.

Esau, too, developed a “root of bitterness” (Hebrews 12:15-17 KJV) because he felt Jacob had stolen his birthright. Naomi, Ruth’s mother-in-law, changed her name to Mara (or bitter) because she lost her husband and two sons through death (Ruth 1:20).

Bitterness can happen to anyone who has been hurt. Reflections of the past can pour back into our minds, spilling poison into the waters of our relationships. But God can turn bitterness into blessing. That’s just what He did when he showed Moses a tree that made the bitter waters sweet.

The cross of Jesus can be thrown into any bitter pool and its waters made sweet. In their darkest hour, Paul and Silas chose to praise God in the Philippian prison (Acts 16:25), and God made their bitter waters sweet.

Only the cross of Christ will keep you free from the root of bitterness as well as the fruit of bitterness: disease. Let the cross sweeten your waters today. Be healed, emotionally and physically, from the waters of Marah."
02-03,02-03,34,This job is too heavy a burden for you to handle all by yourself. ,Exodus 18:18,"The church in the wilderness modeled the biblical pattern of oversight. Leaders of tens, fifties, hundreds, and thousands were selected to care for the basic needs of the people and to settle their disputes. As a result, Moses had to review only the most difficult cases and policies. His primary job was to commune with God and to teach the Word.

The apostles discovered this principle in the selection of deacons, which freed them to use their time “in prayer and preaching and teaching the word” (Acts 6:4). The early church not only met daily in the temple but also gathered “in homes for the Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity (Acts 2:46). Apostles, deacons, and church members all helped carry the load of the growing congregation.

Burned-out pastors and leaders are a testimony to the huge toll of counseling, visiting, and arbitrating required in the church today. In actuality, the pastor is not called to do all ministry, but he is “to equip God’s people to do his work and build up the church” (Ephesians 4:12). Pastors, bring them in, build them up, release their gifts, and send them out. In this way, you will be able to endure as Moses did."
02-04,02-04,35,"You should tithe, yes, but you should not leave undone the more important things. ",Matthew 23:23,"There is the law, and then there is the spirit of the law. In Matthew 23:23, Jesus addressed this issue when He gave His only New Testament statement on tithing. He rebuked the Pharisees for being meticulous in tithing a tenth of each little tiny seed they owned while neglecting the more important parts of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. He did not tell them to abandon their faithful tithing, but He encouraged them to expand their thinking to include the needs of others.

Tithing is biblical. Jesus is the High Priest who receives your tithes (Hebrews 7:8), and tithing will release a supernatural blessing in your life so great that you will not be able to contain it (Malachi 3:10). Above the mere obedience to the duty of the law, however, is the spirit of the law.

As New Testament Christians, we should move beyond the obligation of tithing to showing mercy through the giving of offerings above the tithe to support the needy worldwide. The tithe sustains the local church, and offerings advance world outreach. Start with the tithe, out of duty and obedience. End with the offering, out of love, compassion, and the spirit of the law."
02-05,02-05,36,The voice of the Lord strikes with lightning bolts. ,Psalm 29:7,"As the people of Israel stood next to Mount Sinai and received the commandments of God, the thunder, loud blast of the horn, lightning, and smoke all caused the people to say, “Don’t let God speak directly to us. If he does, we will die!” (Exodus 20:19).

The voice of the Lord is an awesome power, similar to lightning piercing through your entire being. The sound and power of His voice reinforced the fear of God that the Israelites were to show in their dealings with one another. They were not to steal from, oppress, or be unjust to one another in any way. God said, “If you do and they cry out to me, then I will surely help them. My anger will blaze forth against you, and I will kill you with the sword” (Exodus 22:23-24). Anyone who can steal casually from others or from God has never heard the voice of the Lord.

Jesus told His disciples, “For as the lightning lights up the entire sky, so it will be when the Son of Man comes” (Matthew 24:27). Get ready for the greatest manifestation of the voice of the Lord: the return of Christ!"
02-06,02-06,37,"The first is the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. . . .You must also celebrate the Festival of Harvest, when you bring me the first crops of your harvest. Finally, you are to celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest at the end of the harvest season. ",Exodus 23:15-16,"The three feasts of Israel describe how God views human history. The annual calendar for Israel began with the shedding of a lamb’s blood in the Passover (the Feast of Unleavened Bread). Likewise, our salvation began with the shedding of Christ’s blood on the cross.

Next came the Feast of Harvest (Pentecost). The Church in the New Testament also was birthed in a mighty harvest on the day of Pentecost.

The last feast was the Feast of Final Harvest (Tabernacles) held at the end of the year. What a picture that celebration presents of the end of time! A final, culminating harvest will occur, just as at the Feast of Final Harvest when the Israelites gathered in their crops from the field.

Christ told His disciples to watch and be ready for the final harvest and His return. Like a thief in the night, He will return to gather the harvest of those who have been faithful during His absence (Matthew 24). His sudden appearance to rescue His Church will leave one in the field and one at the mill while their partners suddenly disappear. Let’s be ready for the moment of His glorious return. Behold, “His return is very near, right at the door” (v. 33)."
02-07,02-07,38,"Tell the people of Israel to bring you pure olive oil for the lampstand, so it can be kept burning continually. ",Exodus 27:20,"The burning flames of the lampstand represent the “seven spirits of God” mentioned in Revelation 4:5 that burn continually and eternally before the throne of God. Because the flame of worship is never to cease, an unending supply of oil is necessary.

Jesus spoke of seven wise and seven foolish virgins. The primary difference between the two groups was that the wise took extra oil for their lamps, while the foolish did not (Matthew 25:3-4). In this parable, the wise virgins were those whose lives were prepared and ready for the heavenly Bridegroom. They were like the servants who were found using their talents wisely when the Master returned

(v. 19).

The point of these examples is readiness. First is the readiness of a life constantly filled with the Holy Spirit—a life burning brightly day and night in worship. Second is a life that is attentive to the Bride-groom’s call, denying the foolish lusts that drain the oil. Finally is a life that is spiritually productive, developing talents to the fullest potential.

Keep your lamps full, trimmed, and burning. The Bridegroom will come when you least expect Him, and there will be no time to find the oil you need."
02-08,02-08,39,"During supper, a woman came in with a beautiful jar of expensive perfume and poured it over his head. ",Matthew 26:7,"In the Old Testament, the high priest was anointed by the pouring of oil upon his head. In Aaron’s case, it was an amount so profuse that it ran down onto his beard and the collar of his robe (Psalm 133:2). In Matthew 26:7, the woman who anointed Jesus’ head was doing something more significant than she realized. Her act of love was symbolic of Jesus’ role as our great High Priest, an office beautifully understood by examining the garments worn by the priest in Exodus 28.

The most conspicuous garment of the priest was the breastplate. On it were twelve precious jewels, each engraved with one of the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Also significant were the two onyx stones on the high priest’s shoulders, each engraved with six names. It is interesting to note that the jewels and stones were located on the heart and shoulders of the priest, indicating the two places of intercession.

Jesus, our great High Priest, bears our names and needs before the Father continually. We are always on His heart! He carries our needs on His shoulders, making it unnecessary for us to carry them. Instead of worrying about our needs, let us rejoice that He is our anointed High Priest. “He lives forever to plead with God on [our] behalf” (Hebrews 7:25)."
02-09,02-09,40,"Cut up the ram and wash off the internal organs and the legs. Set them alongside the head and the other pieces of the body, and burn them all on the altar. This is a burnt offering to the Lord, which is very pleasing to him. ",Exodus 29:17-18,"There is something about a sacrifice of love that God calls a “pleasing aroma” (Exodus 29:18 NIV). The pure and spotless ram that burned in its entirety on the altar was an acceptable sacrifice that brought God pleasure. In the same way, the world was filled with the stench of sin until the sweet smell of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice was offered to God.

In Gethsemane, Jesus totally submitted His will to the Father (Matthew 26:39) out of devotion to God and love for the world. Christ, the perfect Lamb, climbed onto the altar of God to be sacrificed of His own free will. This perfect offering pleased God eternally.

Now we can please Him by walking in love and serving the needs of others instead of thinking only of ourselves (Ephesians 5:2). Paul called the Philippians’ financial missionary offerings “a sweet-smelling sacrifice that is acceptable to God and pleases him” (Philippians 4:18). Each financial gift given out of personal sacrifice pleases Him immensely. Furthermore, when we sacrifice our right to be bitter and unforgiving in order to choose love, our action permeates God’s throne room as a sweet aroma. Let’s fill heaven with that aroma . . . and the world with the knowledge of Jesus!"
02-10,02-10,41,"The Lord says, “I will guide you along the best pathway for your life. I will advise you and watch over you.” ",Psalm 32:8,"Bezalel had no idea how to build a tabernacle. None had ever been built before! However, God “filled him with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, intelligence, and skill in all kinds of crafts” (Exodus 31:3). God has so much wisdom and creativity that He made not just a tabernacle but also a universe! He “established the heavens” and “marked off the earth’s foundations” (Proverbs 8:27, 29).

The person referred to by the writer of Proverbs was called the “architect at his side” (v. 30). What a joy it is to work alongside God! He is the Creator, and He is able to impart His creativity and wisdom as you work for Him. The key to attaining that creativity is the Holy Spirit.

Bezalel’s ideas did not come from his brain, but from his spirit. In 1 Corinthians 2:10, we read how the “Spirit searches out everything and shows us even God’s deep secrets.” He wants to reveal those secrets to you. So claim His creativity today in your work, your finances, and your ministry. Then build according to the blueprint He shows you!"
02-11,02-11,42,"Happy are those who listen to me, watching for me daily at my gates, waiting for me outside my home! ",Proverbs 8:34,"
How easily our human nature shows through in times of trial! On Mount Sinai, Israel was poised for its greatest hour but failed the test when it came. As Moses was on the mountain receiving the Law, the Israelites waited for his return.  That was all they had to do: wait. The waiting got the best of them, however, and before the time was up, they had made a golden calf and called it their god.

Peter, also, at his most important moment in life, succumbed to the flesh. With Christ being interrogated in a building nearby, Peter denied that he had ever known the Lord. Oh, how weak is the human flesh!

How do you conduct yourself when your leaders are out of sight? Can God trust you to be true to Him even when you wonder where He is in your life? If you seem to be in a “holding pattern,” remain faithful. The time when you think the Lord has deserted you is often the very time when God is actually testing your true character. He is observing you now, so hold steady. The Lord will return when you least expect it!

"
02-12,02-12,43,"He passed in front of Moses and said, “I am the Lord, I am the Lord, the merciful and gracious God. I am slow to anger and rich in unfailing love and faithfulness.” ",Exodus 34:6,"S . . . L . . . O . . . W . . . to anger is definitely a characteristic of the Lord, and quick to anger is what we humans are! We set our agendas for each day, each month, and each year and grow upset when our schedules are violated. We get frustrated with mechanical breakdowns, inefficient service, and difficult relationships.

God’s nature, however, is just the opposite. When He told Moses His name, God revealed that He is compassionate and gracious. Because He is abounding in love and faithfulness, He is more concerned with a person’s needs than with his faults.

How well we need to learn that lesson! A faithful marriage partner, for example, will stick with his spouse even when that person is hard to love. He will live in the light of the scripture found in 2 Timothy 2:13: “If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.”

Besides being faithful and compassionate, God is forgiving (Exodus 34:6-7). Such forgiveness is the crowning virtue of His long-suffering. Because He automatically forgives those who repent of wickedness, God is automatically slow to anger.

Make it a practice to control your anger by instant and spontaneous forgiveness when someone does something to hurt you. If Jesus could forgive the soldiers for their abuse (Matthew 27:28-31), how much more should you be able to control the petty anger and frustrations of everyday life?"
02-13,02-13,44,"So Moses gave the command, and this message was sent throughout the camp: “Bring no more materials! You have already given more than enough.” ",Exodus 36:6,"
Never has there been an illustration of a people more excited and generous toward fulfilling a vision than that of the Israelites giving toward the construction of the tabernacle in the wilderness. The Israelites were so grateful to God for delivering them from Egypt that they delighted to give of their wealth and labor to build a magnificent sanctuary. Loaded with the silver, gold, and jewels that the Egyptians had given them the night of their departure, they willingly set their hearts to work, sew, and build.

The Israelites’ example characterizes the power of the church when united by a common vision. Why not catch the vision of your church and apply your full strength and resources toward making that vision a reality? What has God given you? A talent? Some unexpected income? Some extra time? Find the vision God is building in you and your church and then work with your whole soul toward achieving it until you have to be told, “Enough!”

Jesus gave His all on the cross. He withheld nothing. The least you can do is to give bountifully of the resources His death secured for you!

"
02-14,02-14,45,"The righteous face many troubles, but the Lord rescues them from each and every one. ",Psalm 34:19,"Troubles come in many forms, shapes, and sizes and include anything that disturbs the peace and tranquility of your life. Two things must be expected when you follow the Lord: First, the devil will throw his fiery darts to try to discourage you through troubling circumstances. Second, no matter the affliction, the Lord will deliver you.

How does He do it? The Word of God says, “The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right; his ears are open to their cries for help” (Psalm 34:15). Furthermore, “The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help. He rescues them from all their troubles” (v. 17).  The Lord is watching you and listening to you when you walk through difficulties, and He is eager to rescue you from any trouble.

The disciples faced the deepest despair and trouble of their lives after the crucifixion of Christ. Little did they know, however, that God had a plan and was going to resurrect Christ! That’s the way it is for us, too. We don’t always realize that God is in control in every circumstance of life and has a plan of resurrection waiting to unfold.

When you see the “trouble” side in life, hang in there. You will surely see the “delivering” side as well!"
02-15,02-15,46,"Jesus called out to them, “Come, be my disciples, and I will show you how to fish for people!” ",Mark 1:17,"Throughout history God has called His people to follow Him. That divine mandate to leave all and follow Him is the very crux of the Gospels. God does not need decision-makers—He needs hearers. He is looking for those who will hear His voice and respond, following Him even to the uttermost parts of the earth.

Moses did not make his own decisions concerning the building of the tabernacle but “proceeded to do everything as the Lord had commanded him” (Exodus 40:16). In all the travels of the Israelites, they followed the cloud as instructed, never moving unless the cloud moved (v. 36-37). It was not their place to determine when to move or where to go.  They were totally dependent on God’s guidance.

After He was baptized in the Jordan, “immediately the Holy Spirit compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness” (Mark 1:12). Without questioning or hesitating, Jesus followed the Spirit and went into a most unlikely place. In the same way, many times your mind cannot comprehend the directions of God, but you can be led of Him by your spirit, for you are the temple of the Holy Spirit.

Paul said, “For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God” (Romans 8:14). The cloud of God is no longer above you, but within you! Wait for the “cloud of peace” before moving in any direction. Don’t make a hasty decision, but simply purpose from this day forward to follow the Lamb wherever He goes (Revelation 14:4)."
02-16,02-16,47,The next morning Jesus awoke long before daybreak and went out alone into the wilderness to pray. ,Mark 1:35,"Jesus was busy for God. His days were filled with divine activity in healing the sick, driving out demons, and preaching the Gospel. Throughout His hectic schedule, however, there remained one constant: fellowship with God. Such fellowship was the secret of Jesus’ power in ministry.

You must not get more interested in the work of God than in the God of the work! Spending time with God provides a continual recharging of your spiritual battery. As you fellowship with Him, you are able to both listen to His direction and continually enjoy His presence.

In Leviticus 3:1 Moses spoke of the peace offering. This was an offering given to the Lord simply to express worship and love for Him. After Jesus had spent time alone in worship and prayer to the Father, He knew the direction He was to take and shared it with His disciples: “We must go on to other towns as well, and I will preach to them, too, because that is why I came” (Mark 1:38).

As you draw away to express your love for the Lord in that secret place of prayer, the Lord will show you the next move for your life. So draw aside from the world, climb the hill of God every morning, and be refreshed, redirected, and refired!"
02-17,02-17,48,"Your unfailing love, O Lord, is as vast as the heavens; your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds. ",Psalm 36:5,"Guilt does not simply go away. The modern method of denying guilt just postpones it until a later day. Repressed and denied guilt will always resurface in the form of anger, bitterness, rejection, and failure.

God knows how unforgiven sin will destroy you and your relationship with Him and others. In the Old Testament, He gave instructions for the guilt offering that related to any situation, whether it was the high priest, a leader, an individual, or the entire community that had sinned. The only way to be forgiven in the Old Testament system was to bring an individual sacrifice. Worshipers brought a bull, a goat, a lamb, two pigeons, or a handful of fine flour, depending upon their status and means. No sin or negligence was swept under the rug by God but was paid for by something.

Sinners are Jesus’ specialty. The Bible tells us that not only is God precise with sin, but He is also merciful toward sinners. Take Levi, for example. Jesus accepted Levi’s invitation to dine with him and his friends, who were notorious sinners. When the Pharisees discovered this, they criticized the Lord. Jesus responded, “I have come to call sinners, not those who think they are already good enough”

(Mark 2:17).

Jesus is your “guilt offering.” Release your guilt to the cross and praise Him, knowing that you were once a sinner but now have been forgiven."
02-18,02-18,49,"Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you your heart’s desires. ",Psalm 37:3-4,"Handling opposition is difficult, especially if the opposition is from those you love. Jesus faced opposition continually, even from those in His own family who said, “He’s out of his mind” (Mark 3:21). In addition, Jesus also faced opposition from the teachers of the Law who remarked, “He’s possessed by Satan” (v. 22).

David gave the best prescription for handling opposition. First, he said to trust in the Lord. Never believe that a problem is yours. Just relax as a baby would in the arms of its mother.

Second, David said to delight in the Lord. Keep your focus on the delightful relationship between you and your God. Never let the devil steal your joy and the sense that all is well.

Third, he said to “commit everything you do to the Lord” (Psalm 37:5). Commit means “to roll.” Just shift the weight of opposition from your shoulders onto the shoulders of God. He is more than able to carry it.

Finally, David said in verse 7 of Psalm 37 to “be still.” How quickly we want to take matters into our own hands and begin to “fight fire with fire”! We’ve got to learn, however, to discipline ourselves to wait on the Lord to fight the battle for us.

Trust, delight, commit, and be still, and in the end you will see that the battle belongs to the Lord."
02-19,02-19,50,A wise youth works hard all summer; a youth who sleeps away the hour of opportunity brings shame. ,Proverbs 10:5,"Harvest is a time of high motivation, a time when all the efforts of an entire year come to fruition. How can someone sleep if the grain is standing ready and a storm is coming that can ruin it? If people sleep, they are wasting the blood, sweat, and tears of all the laborers before them. They are turning their backs on the financial rewards the harvest will bring at the market. They are wasting their day of opportunity.

Jesus spoke of those who receive the Word but are distracted by lives of ease and pleasure. Although the harvest is ripe, they are busy pursuing the things of this world. He reminded us that others, however, would be wise sons or daughters who would gather thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold in the day of harvest (Mark 4:20).

We are now in the period of the greatest spiritual harvest the world has ever seen. Hundreds of thousands of new Christians are being saved every day. Lay aside your sleep and wake up! Your summer of harvest may never happen again this side of eternity."
02-20,02-20,51,"When he woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the water, “Quiet down!” ",Mark 4:39,"The command of faith in the mouth of Jesus was astounding. With two words, an entire storm broke, and the violence of death was stilled. The Word of God in your mouth is the most powerful force in the world. Paul said, “The message is close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart” (Romans 10:8).

Jesus is the Word; therefore, when you speak the Word, you are speaking Jesus into your situation. Faith consists of first believing in your heart that God’s Word is true and then speaking that Word to your circumstances and watching them change.

When Jesus spoke the command of faith to the legion of demons, they had no choice but to obey (Mark 5:13). The centurion, too, understood this principle and told the Lord that all that was needed was a simple command from His mouth for his servant to be healed (Matthew 8:8-9).

Joshua spoke to the sun, Jesus spoke to the fig tree, and you can speak to your storms. Expect the Word of God in your mouth to move mountains!"
02-21,02-21,52,"Jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?” ",Mark 5:30,"The Master made no conscious decision to heal the woman with the issue of blood mentioned in this passage. Her faith had decided that Christ was the Source of all healing and that God was no respecter of persons. She believed she could tap into that well of life by faith.

Healing must be received, like a radio receives radio waves. Christ is our Healer, but we must be tenacious and unwavering in our perseverance to receive the healing we need. Someone has said that faith is like a fuse. A fuse is tiny and unassuming, having no power in itself except to complete a circuit so power can flow. The fuse only works with low resistance; otherwise, it will blow! In the same way, Christ is the mighty Generator of the power of God, and we need only keep our little “fuses of faith” in the line.

When the report of his daughter’s death reached his ears, Jairus, like the woman with the issue of blood, kept his “faith fuse” from blowing. He refused to allow fear to blow his fuse and short-circuit his miracle (Mark 5:36).

Tap in today with your “fuse of faith.” Christ the Healer is alive!"
02-22,02-22,53,"Now suppose the priest discovers after his examination that a rash has broken out all over someone’s skin, covering the body from head to foot. In such cases, the priest must examine the infected person to see if the disease covers the entire body. If it does, he will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. . . .” ",Leviticus 13:12-13,"Sin is a spiritual disease that has strong parallels to leprosy in the natural world. In biblical days, leprosy was a progressive, incurable, contagious disease. It was extremely dangerous to the person afflicted even if only a small area was affected.

Why would the Law pronounce a person who had become covered in the disease to be clean? Charles Spurgeon pointed out leprosy’s striking parallel to the consciousness of sin. When we think we have only a spot of sin, we are unclean, but when we realize that we are totally consumed by sin, we can be made clean! God wants us to understand that our own self-righteousness is as “filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). Only as we abandon our claim to being anything good before God can He come in as our great High Priest and make us clean.

Pity those who feel they only need God as a “Band-Aid” on their sin and don’t comprehend that they are totally consumed by the dreaded disease. Come to Jesus repentant, helpless, and hopeless. He will make His eternal pronouncement: You are clean!"
02-23,02-23,54,"O Lord my God, you have done many miracles for us. Your plans for us are too numerous to list. ",Psalm 40:5,"No book could contain the volume of miraculous events that took place during the ministry of Jesus. “Wherever he went . . . they laid the sick in the market plazas and streets. The sick begged him to let them at least touch the fringe of his robe, and all who touched it were healed”

(Mark 6:56). Masses of suffering human beings were carried, laid by the road, and pressed closely to the Master in hopes of receiving just one healing touch. Not one was refused or turned away. Every person who was willing to press in and touch Him received a miracle.

Today, remarkably, more and more miracles are occurring on a worldwide scale. Every day on every continent of the world, thousands receive miraculous healings and deliverances in the name of Jesus. We must take a fresh look at suffering, sighing, dying humanity and purpose to bring this healing, delivering Jesus to their rescue. If we take His name and plunge into the sea of human need, we will find His footsteps and hands following right behind us!"
02-24,02-24,55,You are not defiled by what you eat; you are defiled by what you say and do! ,Mark 7:15,"Unclean was the word the Pharisees most feared. They spent hours washing pots, spots, and dots! They followed and amplified to impossible proportions every little hygienic requirement of the Mosaic Law. Jesus answered the objections of the Pharisees by pointing out that unclean refers more to a state of the heart than to a state of the hands.

Bad attitudes, anger, adulteries, and arrogance cannot be removed from the human heart by any amount of hand washing. Unlike unclean foods that are simply processed through the body and the wastes removed naturally, unclean attitudes sit like poison in the human spirit and wait to spring into actions.

Aaron learned the mystery of cleansing before God: “Then he must dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it seven times over the altar. In this way, he will cleanse it from Israel’s defilement and return it to its former holiness” (Leviticus 16:19). Water may cleanse the body, but only blood can cleanse the spirit! Reach out and apply that blood to your spirit today."
02-25,02-25,56,"And looking up to heaven, he sighed and commanded, “Be opened!” Instantly the man could hear perfectly and speak plainly! ",Mark 7:34-35,"Jesus sighed. This word is used to describe a groan drawn from deep within. Before a miracle occurs, the Holy Spirit must groan, or pray from within us. Romans 8:26 tells us that we do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. That groaning, or inner compassion of the Spirit, always comes right before the works of God are revealed.

Jesus said, “Ephphatha!” (Mark 7:34 KJV), which is an Aramaic word describing the loosing of an entire person, not just a part. Satan had kept this man in bondage, and Christ was commanding him to “be loosed!” The string (or in the Greek, “bondage”) of his tongue was immediately loosed. The process included groaning, commanding, and then loosing!

This is the work of the Church. We are to be so filled with the Holy Spirit that we feel the needs of the poor (Psalm 41:1) and command them to “be loosed!” Ask the Holy Spirit to pray through you for the needs of those in bondage. Satan must loose them because we are of the company of “Ephphatha!”"
02-26,02-26,57,"Never seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone, but love your neighbor as yourself. ",Leviticus 19:18,"As one of the two great commandments Jesus quoted from the Old Testament, this rule consists of five simple words that embody everything else: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” For New Testament believers, the Holy Spirit automatically teaches their hearts to do all that relates to this commandment. But for those who were under the Law, God had to spell out exactly how they should behave.

Leviticus 19 tells us that God instructed His people to be generous (vv. 9-10) and to leave something in the fields for the poor. He commanded them not to steal, lie, or deceive one another (vv. 11-13). He told them to respect the helpless (v. 14) and not to take advantage of them. He directed them to judge their neighbors fairly, not showing favoritism (v. 15). Finally, He told them not to slander, harbor hatred, or seek revenge (vv. 16-18). As simple as these commandments sound, they gave practical steps to the admonition to “love your neighbor.”

Love is the fulfilling of the Law and the highest of God’s commandments. In all your relationships, apply this “royal command” (James 2:8). God will bless you, and others will love you in return!"
02-27,02-27,58,"They must be set apart to God as holy and must never dishonor his name. After all, they are the ones who present the offerings to the Lord by fire, providing God with his food, and they must remain holy. ",Leviticus 21:6,"The requirements for the priesthood were extremely high. Priests were separated unto God and restricted as to whom they could marry because they had “been made holy by the anointing oil of . . . God” (Leviticus 21:12). The high priest could not even touch a dead body or mourn for a dead parent. His emotions, priorities, and focus were restricted by his walk in the anointing.

Walking away from sin is not a difficult choice for those of us who understand how precious is the anointing of the Holy Spirit. We cannot walk, touch, and marry as we choose. We willingly restrict our lives in order to avoid grieving the Holy Spirit of God. Others may be able to compromise their lifestyles with seemingly no penalty, but our choices all center on keeping His anointing. We are totally devoted unto God. Our lives are our ministries, and our callings are our priorities.

On the Mount of Transfiguration, Christ’s anointing shone through His very garments (Mark 9:3). So strong was the anointing that demons ran when confronted with it (v. 26). Is it worthwhile to desire that kind of anointing? Absolutely! Receive it, walk in it, and minister in it. Nothing in life is as precious as the anointing."
02-28,02-28,59,"O God, we give glory to you all day long and constantly praise your name. ",Psalm 44:8,"
Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles were the three Jewish calendar feasts. Passover exemplifies our salvation, for Passover is the time when we remember how the blood of Jesus has been applied to the doorposts of our hearts. Pentecost, the day when the firstfruits were reaped, represents our baptism in the Holy Spirit. The Feast of Tabernacles, a seven-day celebration of the completion of Solomon’s temple, depicts a futuristic, eternal celebration of the completion of harvest.

Heaven will be the place of celebration at the completion of the heavenly temple, at the final ingathering of the harvest. Heaven is the place where Christ’s victory over Satan will be celebrated forever. Heaven will be an eternal camp meeting where cares are left behind, total rest and refreshing are continual, and joy is unbridled. Throughout the long year of labor, let us anticipate the final feast at the end of time. In that day, our labors will be over, and God will be our entire reward.

"
03-01,03-01,60,"As he was starting out on a trip, a man came running up to Jesus, knelt down, and asked, “Good Teacher, what should I do to get eternal life?” ",Mark 10:17,"Money is a central heart issue in the Gospel. The rich young ruler mentioned in the book of Mark made a profession of faith, but his money did not follow. Promises of love and discipleship to Jesus are empty unless your possessions mean nothing compared to Him. The way a person uses money is always a reflection of what’s in his heart. If Jesus had occupied first place in the rich young ruler’s heart, it would have been evidenced in his attitude toward his money.

In Leviticus 25 the principle of the Sabbath year brought up an issue similar to the story of the rich young ruler. Simply stated, the people were told to give up something they wanted for God’s sake. God then promised that He would order a blessing so bountiful that it would produce a triple harvest for three years!

When will we ever learn that if we follow God’s laws of sacrifice and obedience, He is well able to speak to our circumstances with His blessing? Jesus promised, “I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property, for my sake and for the Good News, will receive now in return, a hundred times over, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and property. . . .” (Mark 10:29-30).

Don’t resent sacrifice. See it as an opportunity to increase!"
03-02,03-02,61,"Put on your sword, O mighty warrior! You are so glorious, so majestic! ",Psalm 45:3,"Can there be any doubt that the psalmist was referring to Jesus? The disciples were “filled with dread” (Mark 10:32) at the fearless, bold approach Jesus exhibited as He walked to Jerusalem, straight into the face of death. He had told them earlier exactly what would happen to Him, yet He did not flinch in leading the way to the city!

In Leviticus 26:1-39, the Lord promised peace and blessing to the Israelites for obedience, but certain destruction if they rebelled. Christ’s intense love for righteousness and hatred of wickedness gives Him a fearless boldness against sin (Psalm 45:7).

The ultimate act of Jesus’ hatred of sin will be demonstrated by His return to earth. He will “ride out to victory, defending truth, humility, and justice, [going] forth to perform awe-inspiring deeds!” (Psalm 45:4). His sharp arrows will pierce the hearts of our enemies, and the nations will fall beneath His feet (v. 5). At His side will be the Church, His Bride, who loves Him and also loves righteousness.

Be faithful and fearless, Bride—Your Mighty One is coming with His sword, and you will be at His side!"
03-03,03-03,62,"A tenth of the produce of the land, whether grain or fruit, belongs to the Lord and must be set apart to him as holy. ",Leviticus 27:30,"Our understanding must change if we are to see that the tithe already belongs to the Lord. When we return it to Him, we are not giving. In fact, if it already belongs to Him, we are actually robbing God if we use the tithe or spend it!

Not only does the tithe belong to Him, but also it is holy to the Lord. The tithe is holy money, set aside for His holy use. When Achan stole from Jericho something that had been set aside unto God, judgment fell upon Achan and his house (Joshua 7).

Another aspect of the tithe is that it belongs to the Lord as His advance provision. In Mark 11:3, the little donkey was there by God’s prophetic command (Zechariah 9:9), marked out centuries before as provision for what the King would need in that generation.

A final point regarding the tithe is that God will return your tithe to you with a blessing for your obedience. Weren’t the owners of the donkey told, “The Lord needs it and will return it soon” (Mark 11:3)? God is not robbing you of ten percent when you tithe—He is using it as an opportunity to bless you!"
03-04,03-04,63,"So the total of all the troops on Judah’s side of the camp is 186,400. These three tribes are to lead the way whenever the Israelites travel to a new campsite.",Numbers 2:9,"The tribe of Judah was privileged by God to lead Israel’s march through the wilderness. God had already showed His blessing upon that tribe by causing them to increase in number to the largest of all the tribes. Judah means “praise,” and this tribe was selected to raise the voice of praise as a battle cry for God’s people. As the vast camp set out each day with the blowing of the trumpets, God was displaying to the world that His great Church sets out with a shout of praise.

The psalmist said, “God has ascended with a mighty shout. The Lord has ascended with trumpets blaring. Sing praise to God, sing praises; sing praise to our King, sing praises!” (Psalm 47:5-6). The Church was created to praise the King. Clapping our hands and shouting with cries of joy are the most appropriate things we can do for the One who is the great King over all the earth!

Jehoshaphat taught God’s people to sing and shout as they went out into battle. He “appointed singers to walk ahead of the army, singing to the Lord and praising him for his holy splendor” (2 Chronicles 20:21). As a result, the Lord used their praise to defeat their enemies.

What problem are you facing today?  Why not “send Judah first” and watch the Lord fight the battle for you!"
03-05,03-05,64,"Jesus replied, “The most important commandment is this: ‘Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is the one and only Lord. And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.’ The second is equally important: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these.” ",Mark 12:29-31,"God has given two great commandments, the first of which deals with devotion and service to God. Numbers 4:1-33 explains how the three divisions of Levites supervised such work: they were to care for the tabernacle, furniture, and courtyard with the utmost precision and dedication. Similarly, our service to God is not to be slipshod and haphazard, but precise, heartfelt, and fervent. Whatever our ministries, whether small or great, we must serve the Lord with passion. Having even the slightest responsibility for holy things is a privilege!

The second commandment, to love your neighbor as yourself, is illustrated in Numbers 5:6-7 through the law of restitution. With all our effort, we must make restitution with our neighbors, reconciling any differences with them and treating them with respect and honor, for God keeps account of our dealings with others. As Christians, we are compelled to go the extra mile to ensure our relationships are secured in love.

Let us build our lives on zealous love for both God and humanity. Such love is the Kingdom of God."
03-06,03-06,65,"They trust in their wealth and boast of great riches. Yet they cannot redeem themselves from death by paying a ransom to God. Redemption does not come so easily, for no one can ever pay enough to live forever and never see the grave. ",Psalm 49:6-9,"What folly it is to trust in our wealth and boast of our great riches! The psalmist described the futility of hoarding wealth, which has no power to redeem our lives from sin. Ultimately, all the wealth we amass will be left to others. The psalmist continued, saying that the rich will not be pampered forever on their estates. One day they will die, taking none of their worldly wealth with them. Like all men, their bodies will rot in their graves.

Someone once said, “You will be dead a lot longer than you will be alive!” We would be looked upon as foolish to think we could send treasures to heaven ahead of ourselves.  Everyone knows that is impossible. The only way we can take any wealth into eternity is to give it to God here on earth and reap our eternal reward.

The story of the sacrificial widow clearly illustrates how God will reward us in eternity. It is not the amount given but the amount sacrificed that matters to God. The amount we give may be small, but if it represents great sacrifice, it is of more value to God than great riches. Just as each tabernacle offering was recorded in Numbers 7, so each of our offerings is recorded in God’s eternal record. We will find those treasures in heaven for all eternity!"
03-07,03-07,66,"Our God approaches with the noise of thunder. Fire devours everything in his way, and a great storm rages around him. ",Psalm 50:3,"These three little words—our God approaches—are the most certain fact in the universe. We may be going through terrible trials, tribulations, sufferings, and temptations, but we can be certain of one thing: our God is coming! One day Christ will return to earth. A fire will devour before Him (v. 3) as He returns to destroy the Antichrist and his armies. God Himself will be the Judge of His people (v. 6).

The concept of Jesus’ return took center stage as Christ taught His disciples about the end of time. “However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows” (Mark 13:32). Since we cannot know the moment of His return, we must remain diligently on our guard, for His arrival could be “at evening, midnight, early dawn, or late daybreak”

(v. 35).

As we battle the enemy, we should be constantly looking skyward for the imminent return of our Lord. Focusing on His coming will keep us on guard against sin, compromise, and slothfulness and will encourage us in battle. We must keep our lives equipped and our hearts ready, because there will be no time for preparation at His sudden return. To the sleeping, distracted, halfhearted Christian, Jesus gives one word that will keep him on track for life: “Watch!” (Mark 13:37)."
03-08,03-08,67,"Some of those at the table were indignant. “Why was this expensive perfume wasted?” they asked. “She could have sold it for a small fortune and given the money to the poor!” And they scolded her harshly. But Jesus replied, “Leave her alone. Why berate her for doing such a good thing to me?” ",Mark 14:4-6,"The beautiful nature of God is one of sacrifice, the giving of something on behalf of another. The ugly nature of Satan is one of selfishness, the taking of that which belongs to another.

Never have the spirits of sacrifice and selfishness been so starkly contrasted as in the Mark 14:3-10 story of a generous woman and the self-serving Judas Iscariot. The woman was reckless in her sacrifice, pouring over Jesus’ head a perfume so expensive it was worth a whole year’s salary. However, her sacrifice seems insignificant when we consider that it was anointing His head for burial. This was the last act of love shown to Jesus before His death.

Since that time, millions have read and appreciated the memory of her act, even though her money, perfume, and possessions have all long since passed from the scene. In our lives, the unselfish, beautiful sacrifices we make for Jesus and His Body will live and return to us forever. By contrast, Judas’s hideously greedy act of fattening his purse with thirty pieces of blood money has gone down in infamy.

What is the final memory others will have of you? Will it be one of sacrifice or one of selfishness? Break open your “alabaster jar,” and pour it all out on the Lord and His people."
03-09,03-09,68,"I wish that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them all! ",Numbers 11:29,"The plague of small thinking strikes again! Joshua was extremely concerned that someone other than Moses might be used of God to prophesy. Joshua did not comprehend that God can use whomever He wants in order to accomplish whatever He wants.

In Numbers 13 the ten spies had to make a decision regarding the grapes and the giants. Huge clusters of fruit should have captured the Israelites’ attention, faith, and excitement. Instead, their eyes were on the giants who stood guard over the abundance.

The devil always tries to get our attention focused more on his resistance than on God’s provision. A small, limited vision will make us feel “like grasshoppers” in comparison to the giants (Numbers 13:33), instead of feeling that “we can certainly conquer” (v. 30)!

Philip rehearsed to Jesus how impossible it was to feed five thousand men in the wilderness, but Andrew went and found five loaves and two fish. Small thinking involves meditating on negative, impossible thoughts that outweigh the truth of God’s Word. Although Moses had told the spies to go into the land with boldness and bring back a sampling of the crops (Numbers 13:20), the spies’ fearful thinking caused them to believe that they could never get to the grapes because the giants were too large.

Think large: Conquest . . . good report . . . well able!"
03-10,03-10,69,"Jesus said, “I am, and you will see me, the Son of Man, sitting at God’s right hand in the place of power and coming back on the clouds of heaven.” ",Mark 14:62,"Jesus stood before the high priest and boldly declared who He was. There stood Christ, unafraid of death, declaring before all men His identity and their judgment. His bold, resilient declaration ignited a storm like a match in a powder keg. Oh, what a difference the presence of the Holy Spirit makes as He gives us boldness to fearlessly declare our witness for God!

How opposite Jesus’ assertion was from Peter’s timid, fearful denial of who He was just six verses later. Peter shrank back, cursing, swearing, and denying that he had ever known Christ. If “fearing people is a dangerous trap” as Proverbs 29:25 declares, then Peter fell headlong into that trap. What a change we can observe in Peter’s life, however, when he stood up on the day of Pentecost, demanding repentance from the men who had crucified Christ!

Joshua and Caleb demonstrated the same boldness when facing a whole assembly that was about to stone them (Numbers 14:10). Never let the fear of man intimidate you in your greatest hour of destiny. Others may run, hide, and deny, but you must stand tall and be bold."
03-11,03-11,70,May my enemies’ plans for evil be turned against them. Do as you promised and put an end to them. ,Psalm 54:5,"It is true that God will repay those who falsely accuse us, but how hard it is to remain silent and let God exact vengeance! Moses and Aaron knew this truth, as their attitudes remained perfect when faced with the strongest challenge to their authority in the wilderness. The “gainsaying of Core” (Jude 11 KJV) is marked as the most slanderous, dangerous illustration of rebellion in the Old Testament. Moses could have easily ordered the opposing leaders’ deaths or fought them in a fistfight. Instead, he “threw himself down with his face to the ground” (Numbers 16:4). He chose to let God execute His own justice.

Christ displayed a quiet, humble spirit before Pilate. In spite of wave upon wave of slanderous accusations, “Jesus said nothing, much to Pilate’s surprise” (Mark 15:5). The moment arrived when both Moses and Jesus were justified by God before all men—Moses when the ground swallowed Korah, and Jesus through the resurrection.

Be patient, humble, and quiet before your God.  Proclaim with the psalmist, “But God is my helper. The Lord is the one who keeps me alive!” (Psalm 54:4)."
03-12,03-12,71,"When he went into the Tabernacle of the Covenant the next day, he found that Aaron’s staff, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, blossomed, and produced almonds! ",Numbers 17:8,"One rod ended an entire insurrection. What a powerful rod this was to have amazed, confounded, and brought to repentance the powerful forces opposing Moses! The miracle of this rod was that it represented something impossible: a resurrection. How could a dead stick—separated from the tree trunk, polished and smoothed— suddenly sprout leaves, buds, and almonds? Only by the resurrection power of God!

Christianity is the only religion whose leader was dead for three days and then physically resurrected. While all other religions are as mere sticks with man-made claims to authority, Christianity is distinguished by the fact that Jesus’ rod has budded. This budding rod has persuaded millions that He is truly the Son of God. People of every nation stand in awe that someone beaten, crucified, and speared in the side could stand three days later and say, “All hail.”

His name has all authority over demons, disaster, and disease (Mark 16:17-18). We, as His disciples, can stand holding the rod of the resurrection in our hands. Let us preach the Gospel of the resurrected Christ to all creation and watch the Lord confirm His Word with signs following (Mark 16:20)!"
03-13,03-13,72,"And now, since you didn’t believe what I said, you won’t be able to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly come true at the proper time. ",Luke 1:20,"Unbelief is dangerous, regardless of who you are. Zechariah, a member of the priestly tribe, was standing in the Holy Place offering incense before God when an angel of the Lord brought him a message. Because he refused to believe the message and questioned the power of God, Zechariah was struck dumb.

Another example of unbelief is found in Numbers 20:11-12, which tells how Moses’ and Aaron’s lack of trust in God led them to act rashly. They struck the rock twice instead of merely speaking to it as God had instructed. This simple act of unbelief disqualified them from their long-awaited entrance into the Promised Land.

God does not exempt His leaders from judgment if they fail to walk before Him in the purity of faith. He “doesn’t show partiality” (Acts 10:34) and equally dispenses judgment on all who refuse to believe. His judgment can be swift and stern, as when Uzzah was struck dead for steadying the ark of the covenant after the oxen stumbled (1 Chronicles 13:9-10). In another instance, “Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu put coals of fire in their incense burners and sprinkled incense over it” (Leviticus 10:1) and were immediately burned alive by the fire of God.

God is awesome in His holiness and will not be disregarded.  Let’s serve Him with the proper respect and awe, “for our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:29)."
03-14,03-14,73,By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. ,Proverbs: 11:11 KJV,"No better example of this scripture can be found than in the story of the little maiden named Mary. Though she was young and from a lowly town in Galilee called Nazareth, Mary believed God. Because of her belief, all generations have called her blessed.

The examples from the Bible are many of those whom God exalted. As a nation, Israel was blessed and exalted. When Balak tried to curse God’s people, God told him, “You are not to curse these people, for I have blessed them!” (Numbers 22:12). Yet another example of the exalting of the Lord is found in the life of David, who was taken from the field while tending a few sheep and exalted to be king of Israel. Joseph, who was languishing in an Egyptian prison, also witnessed the blessing of the Lord that brought him to Pharaoh’s right hand in exaltation.

We must value the blessing of the Lord upon our lives because it exalts us before the heathen and brings great glory to God. May the blessing bestowed upon a simple virgin of Nazareth remind us of one eternal truth: God’s “mighty arm does tremendous things! How he scatters the proud and haughty ones! He has taken princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly” (Luke 1:51-52).

Be blessed . . . then exalted!"
03-15,03-15,74,"Then King Balak demanded of Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies. Instead, you have blessed them!” ",Numbers 23:11,"The tongue is the center of sin in the body. In James 3:6 it is described as a “flame of fire,” capable of causing much wickedness. How important it is, therefore, that the tongue be used for the purposes of God!

In Numbers 22 we see an astounding miracle of speech rendered by God. Balaam’s donkey obviously could not speak, but it was given words to rebuke Balaam in his madness (v. 28). If God could open the mouth of a donkey, how much more can He open our mouths for His glory! Further along in the story, Balaam, being unable to curse Israel with his mouth, could only speak a blessing over the nation.

In the story of Elizabeth and Zechariah, God struck Zechariah dumb for nine months because he had used his tongue to voice unbelief. Then God healed him supernaturally and filled his mouth with a blessing for Israel (Luke 1:67). Zechariah absolutely overflowed with praise to the God of Israel who was showing them mercy, rescuing them from their enemies, and granting them salvation.

Before we met Christ, we used our mouths to curse, defile, and destroy others. Now that Christ lives in us, we can yield our speech to the Holy Spirit so we may instruct, correct, and encourage others. Offer your tongue to God as “the pen of a skillful poet” (Psalm 45:1). He will fill your mouth with praise and prophecy that will bring glory to God and bind the powers of darkness."
03-16,03-16,75,"I see him, but not in the present time. I perceive him, but far in the distant future. A star will rise from Jacob; a scepter will emerge from Israel. ",Numbers 24:17,"We call the leading character in a movie, a play, or an athletic event the star. God has a Star and desires that every eye be upon Him!

In his final prophecies, Balaam saw a vision of a star rising out of Jacob. In the distance beyond the camp of Israel, Balaam could see Israel’s supreme Leader who would crush Moab. When the devil looks out over the Church, he is blinded by the light of our Bright and Morning Star, the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus rises above all our enemies in His glory.

The shepherds saw the Star of all history face-to-face the night He was born in a manger (Luke 2:16). Tradition says the star Balaam saw was the same one the wise men followed from the East to find Christ. Moved by the Spirit, Simeon entered the temple and held in his arms the “light to reveal God to the nations” (Luke 2:32).

May we never move our eyes away from the Centerpiece of God’s universe: Jesus, the Star of Jacob."
03-17,03-17,76,But you have raised a banner for those who honor you—a rallying point in the face of attack. ,Psalm 60:4,"God is a God of victory. The Church is not on the defensive, but displays a banner of victory. We see this banner as David went into battle, for he reminded himself of God’s overwhelming strength against the enemy. We see this banner in Romans 8:31, where Paul wrote, “If God is for us, who can ever be against us?”

The nations of the world do not belong to the devil, but to God. His Church is the means by which the nations will be conquered. The first part of Psalm 60:8 declares, “Moab will become my lowly servant,” meaning that the nations will serve the Church. The second part of that verse says, “Over Edom will I cast out my shoe” (KJV), indicating ownership. (In biblical times, ownership was marked by a person’s taking off his shoe and throwing it down upon his inheritance.)

How many nations are waiting to be claimed by the Body of Christ? Let’s “take our shoes off”and begin in prayer to “throw them down” upon our inheritance. Let’s lift high the banner of the cross of Christ, valiantly defying the claim of the enemy over our God-given heritage. May we never forget that “in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us” (Romans 8:37 KJV)."
03-18,03-18,77,"For you have heard my vows, O God. You have given me an inheritance reserved for those who fear your name. ",Psalm 61:5,"Your spiritual inheritance is the most important thing you possess. The daughters of Zelophehad knew that and thus demanded their inheritance (Numbers 27:4). They refused to let any factor stand in their way of possessing what their father had left to them, and consequently, God honored their faith.

Your spiritual inheritance may be the transfer of someone else’s anointing to you before that person’s death. Moses transferred his anointing to Joshua by the laying on of hands (Numbers 27:23). Jesus received His inheritance when He went into the Jordan and was baptized by John (Luke 3:21-22). Elisha appropriated his inheritance when he saw Elijah go up in a whirlwind and drop his mantle from the chariot (2 Kings 2:11-13).

God has given you a mantle of inheritance—some ministry, some mission, some calling—that belongs to you alone. Will you be like Esau who despised his inheritance and birthright and sold it all for a little bowl of soup? Never forfeit or throw your heritage away as though it were worthless. Instead, seize it, claim it, and believe that God will use it to glorify His name."
03-19,03-19,78,"O my people, trust in him at all times. Pour out your heart to him, for God is our refuge. ",Psalm 62:8,"Faith is trust, and trust is faith. When a deposit is placed in a trust account, we can be confident that it is safe. Do we trust God like that? It is easy to trust Him when we are in control, but what about when the situation moves outside our control? Can we trust Him at all times? David went through perilous times, but in each situation he would pour out his heart to God (v. 8) as his chief Confidant and Refuge.

Everyone trusts someone or something, and with many, it is their money. “Don’t try to get rich by extortion or robbery. And if your wealth increases, don’t make it the center of your life” (Psalm 62:10). Paul told Timothy to “tell those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money, which will soon be gone. But their trust should be in the living God, who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment” (1 Timothy 6:17).

We must unplug our trust from anything in this world: our money, the promises of others, even ourselves. We must then transfer our total trust to God and relax, knowing that our deposit is safe!"
03-20,03-20,79,"O God, you are my God; I earnestly search for you. My soul thirsts for you; my whole body longs for you in this parched and weary land where there is no water. ",Psalm 63:1,"Jesus spent His first forty days after baptism in the wilderness east of Jerusalem. Far from the distractions of life, He passed through the fires of temptation and learned total dependence upon God.

Moses said to Israel, “Anything made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead—that is, metals that do not burn—must be passed through fire in order to be made ceremonially pure” (Numbers 31:22-23). Nothing is acceptable to God unless it has been passed through the fire. Temptation proves the quality of your “metal.” Though Jesus was severely tempted three times by the devil, He came forth as purest gold.

While Jesus was passing through the temptation, a second dynamic was taking place in His life: He was drawing into close communion with the Father. His soul and His body, though fasting, were satisfied with “more than the richest of foods” (Psalm 63:5) as He learned to cling to God (v. 8) in close communion.

These two lessons are our greatest challenges: “Resist the Devil” and “draw close to God” (James 4:7-8). Are you ready for the lessons of the wilderness?"
03-21,03-21,80,The Lord had defeated the gods of Egypt that night with great acts of judgment! ,Numbers 33:4,"Israel realized that the gods of Egypt that had held them captive for so long were defeated through the ten plagues. For example, the “god of the Nile” was defeated when the mighty river was turned to blood (Exodus 7:20-21), and the “sun god” was defeated by the darkness that fell upon the land (Exodus 10:21-23). After the final plague concerning the firstborn, the Israelites were free to go. Triumphantly they left the land of their captivity. They did not slither out of town or run for their lives in the night. Instead, they “left defiantly, in full view of all the Egyptians” (Numbers 33:3).

As New Testament believers, we have the same privilege of boldness as did the Israelites. Jesus has conquered our enemies: “The time of judgment for the world has come, when the prince of this world will be cast out” (John 12:31). Therefore, we should exhibit the same boldness against the devil as did Jesus when He openly ordered the demon to “be silent” (Luke 4:35). Jesus saw sickness and demonic possession as an unfair encroachment of the enemy, and so should we.

Rise up today and boldly break free from Satan’s chains and bondage. The price has been paid for your freedom. Purpose to serve Pharaoh no more!"
03-22,03-22,81,"And the Lord said to Moses, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, designate cities of refuge for people to flee to if they have killed someone accidentally.’ ” ",Numbers 35:9-11,"Forgiveness and mercy are the highest items on God’s agenda. The city of refuge was a designated place of grace where someone who had made a mistake could run for shelter and protection from revenge. When the high priest died, the person who had been spared from judgment was also restored to a normal life.

The man let down through the roof into Jesus’ presence heard Jesus tell him, “Son, your sins are forgiven” (Luke 5:20). That one statement encompassed both his forgiveness and his healing. When your sins are forgiven, healing is easy!

Jesus, our High Priest, died in our place. Now we are free to live as forgiven, restored sinners. When we were overcome by our sins, Jesus forgave our transgressions (Psalm 65:3). Though we cannot see sin, it is an overwhelming enemy. It afflicts us, crushes the life out of us, and can take us to hell forever.

Run to the city of refuge! Run to the mercy seat! You are forgiven through the blood of Christ, and now, like the paralytic, you can “stand up, take your mat, and go on home” (Luke 5:24)."
03-23,03-23,82,But you brought us to a place of great abundance. ,Psalm 66:12,"Three powerful verses in Proverbs 11 remind us of the ageless principles of giving. First, you cannot outgive God. Proverbs 11:24 says, “It is possible to give freely and become more wealthy, but those who are stingy will lose everything.” Giving is the secret to abundance and increase.

Second, if you purpose in life to “refresh others” (Proverbs 11:25) and not just be concerned for yourself, God will be sure to supply your own needs as well. You must make it your goal in life to bring joy and happiness to others through generously giving to them. You will be personally refreshed from watching their joy, and God will make certain that someone comes along occasionally to refresh you!

Finally, if you hoard what you have been given instead of sharing it, you will be cursed instead of blessed (Proverbs 11:26). Because giving is so much a part of God’s nature, your gift brings you into His heavenly economy. Even though you may have a need, invest in others, and you will gain, prosper, and be crowned with blessing!"
03-24,03-24,83,"Stop judging others, and you will not be judged. Stop criticizing others, or it will all come back on you. If you forgive others, you will be forgiven. If you give, you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full measure. . . .",Luke 6:37-38,"It is no accident that the word forgive comes from the word give. Jesus taught both principles in conjunction with each other. If you forgive, you will receive forgiveness.  If you give, others will also give to you. The spirits of forgiveness and giving are opposite from the spirits of the devil.

People in the world lash out at anyone who mistreats or abuses them. Jesus said, however,“God blesses you who are hated and excluded and mocked and cursed because you are identified with me, the Son of Man. When that happens, rejoice! Yes, leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. . ..” (Luke 6:22-23). He also encouraged His disciples to love, do good, and pray for those who mistreated them (vv. 27-28). In the same passage He continued, saying, “Give what you have to anyone who asks you for it; and when things are taken away from you, don’t try to get them back” (v. 30).

You are called to be God’s channel of mercy. He wants to use you to pour His grace and blessing upon the world. You must not block that flow through unforgiveness or stinginess. You must let forgiveness and giving flow. When you do, God will bless you, “full measure, pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, and running over” (Luke 6:38). Give and forgive. “Then your reward from heaven will be very great….” (v. 35)."
03-25,03-25,84,And the Lord spoke to you from the fire. You heard his words but didn’t see his form; there was only a voice. ,Deuteronomy 4:12,"God is different from all other supposed gods in that He is invisible and His Word is His power. The idols of the earth are just senseless, speechless gods “that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell” (v. 28). By contrast, our God is a “devouring fire, a jealous God” (v. 24). How important it is then for us to hear and heed His voice!

The centurion in the New Testament recognized the power of Jesus’ voice: “Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed” (Luke 7:7). Our faith, too, rests in the voice of our invisible God. When God speaks, it is with the voice of absolute authority. His Word contains the power of His ability!

Why do we look for tokens and trinkets of religion when we have His Word? Whether thundering and booming from Sinai or softly spoken from the pages of our Bible, His Word is the same. “The Lord announced the word, and great was the company of those who proclaimed it” (Psalm 68:11 NIV)."
03-26,03-26,85,"And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength. ",Deuteronomy 6:5,"Loving the Lord your God with all your heart is the greatest commandment. It means you should love Him intimately—an action called worship. One who loves his beloved intimately is totally focused on that person, giving to him his heart, soul, and strength.

In heaven, the angels and saints spend eternity worshiping and loving God. Should it be odd for us to spend time with Him now, worshiping and loving the One who is the total focus of our lives?

The second great commandment says, “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18). We call this action ministry. Jesus modeled this commandment when He met the funeral procession coming out of Nain. Luke records, “When the Lord saw her, his heart overflowed with compassion. ‘Don’t cry!’ he said” (Luke 7:13).

This is true ministry: loving people and their problems with all your heart, soul, and strength. Learn to make your worship to God and your ministry to people the two focal points of your life. This is love and the path to eternal joy."
03-27,03-27,86,"Not long afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby cities and villages to announce the Good News concerning the Kingdom of God. He took his twelve disciples with him, along with some women he had healed and from whom he had cast out evil spirits. . . .",Luke 8:1-2,"The women who traveled with Jesus and His disciples were “contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples”

(Luke 8:3). Joanna was the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household. She obviously was a person of great means, and God used her as a channel to supply the needs of the Son of God here on earth.

What a privilege it must have been to give one’s personal wealth for Jesus’ daily provision of food, clothing, and shelter! While Jesus presented the life-giving Word to the cities and villages in the area, these generous and loving women kept the supply lines open to the battlefront.

Wealth is given by God to finance His purposes in redeeming humanity (Deuteronomy 8:17-18). He blessed His people in Palestine, “a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking” (v. 9). He still blesses His people with wealth today, not so they can hoard it and become proud, but as a means for world evangelism.

Claim your abundance, and then pour it upon the feet of Jesus (Luke 7:37-38). You will not lose your wealth, for in eternity you will find it again."
03-28,03-28,87,"Therefore, cleanse your sinful hearts and stop being stubborn. ",Deuteronomy 10:16,"A proud, resistant heart pays no attention to the Word of God. Israel was stubborn, self-willed, disobedient, and hardhearted. How often have we followed suit and lived in habits and patterns that were obviously contrary to the Word of God? However, a tender heart that receives the Word of God and submits to it is precious to the Lord.

Jesus encouraged His disciples to be those of a noble and good heart, who heard the Word, retained it, and by persevering would “steadily produce a huge harvest” (Luke 8:15). The more tender our hearts and the more attentive our ears, the more revelation God will give us (v. 18). Jesus’ own mother and brothers did not qualify as much as those who heard God’s Word and put it into practice (v. 21).

When you read something in God’s Word, receive it with a tender, honest heart. Give it first place, apply it, and let it change you. As you do, you will cultivate the ground of your heart for a harvest—thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold!"
03-29,03-29,88,"One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s cross over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and started out. ",Luke 8:22,"On the other side of the Sea of Galilee, Satan was holding a choice prisoner. This man, totally bound by Satan, was naked and homeless. When Jesus arrived on the scene, the demons in the man violently protested. We need not think that we will invade darkened lands, cultures, and strongholds without experiencing resistance. Someone said, “If you never run into the devil, you must be going the same way!”

Satan hates our mission. We are traveling into his territory, invading the kingdom of darkness. The storms we encounter are diversions to discourage us from reaching those whom Satan considers his trophies. When Jesus set out to confront the demoniac, Satan tried to stop him. A storm “came down” (v. 23 NIV), but Jesus “got up”"
03-30,03-30,89,"Now that I am old and gray, do not abandon me, O God. Let me proclaim your power to this new generation, your mighty miracles to all who come after me. ",Psalm 71:18,"The psalmist was concerned that he not be forsaken until God declared His power to the next generation. Every generation must know firsthand the power of God. It is not enough to hear about how God visited the previous generation in great power, wonders, and miracles. Our generation must see that power manifested. Without a true manifestation of the power of God, each generation grows progressively dubious of God’s reality.

“One day Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them power and authority to cast out demons and to heal all diseases” (Luke 9:1). This action was more than simple religious protocol—it was a transferal of Jesus’ power to the next generation. What would have happened to the world if Christ had departed without giving anyone the same power He had to help people?

The same power that flowed from Christ’s robes to heal the woman with the issue of blood is available today. From generation to generation, God’s power has been passed on. Now it is our turn to rise up and show God’s power to the next generation."
03-31,03-31,90,"When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy these laws on a scroll for himself in the presence of the Levitical priests. He must always keep this copy of the law with him and read it daily as long as he lives. That way he will learn to fear the Lord his God by obeying all the terms of this law. ",Deuteronomy 17:18-19,"How important it is to have your own knowledge of the Word of God! What your parents or grandparents knew and taught you about the Word of God should not be your only source of revelation. Your own eyes must see God’s Word, and then you must hide it inside your heart.

If Solomon had obeyed Moses’ command to produce a handwritten copy of the law (Deuteronomy 17:14-20), he would have known for himself some important things. For example, he would have known not to acquire horses from Egypt, take multiple wives, or accumulate large amounts of silver and gold (vv. 16-17). Obedience to these three simple commands would have kept him from all his troubles. In fact, however, these were the very sins he committed (1 Kings 10:26-11:13). What a tragedy! If only Solomon had hidden God’s Word in his heart, he might not have sinned against God (Psalm 119:11).

Your own personal, diligent, daily study of the Word will undoubtedly protect you from much deception and heartache. Moses passed down suitable guidelines for a king, instructing that he read them daily throughout his life. In the same way, if you read God’s Word every day and hide its truths in your heart, you will be equipped to live it."
04-01,04-01,91,"I will raise up a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites. I will tell that prophet what to say, and he will tell the people everything I command him. ",Deuteronomy 18:18,"Moses spoke of a prophet who would be raised up from among his own brothers. He would be so powerful that His word would be final. Anyone who did not listen to Him would have to give an account to God.

All Israel watched and waited for the special prophet. The priests and Levites asked John the Baptist if he were “that prophet” (John 1:21 KJV). On the day of Pentecost, Peter quoted the verse from Deuteronomy 18 to show how the Lord Jesus Christ was the Prophet spoken of. As such, He was God’s ultimate mouthpiece and final authority. After years of looking for the prophet, Moses finally saw Him face-to-face on the Mount of Transfiguration (Luke 9:30-31).

The nations of the world are looking for some sorcerer, diviner, teacher, or prophet who can tell them the mind of God. They need look no further! We have found “that Prophet” in Christ. Other prophets may prophesy, but if their words do not line up with the words of Jesus, they are false prophets. The true Prophet has come, and we must keep our eyes focused on Him alone."
04-02,04-02,92,"As the time drew near for his return to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. ",Luke 9:51,"Jesus set for His disciples the example of a resolute life. He was determined to accomplish His purpose for coming to this earth.  He tolerated no double-mindedness in His followers. He wanted them to be determined, resolved, bold, and steady. He challenged them to totally cast aside their comforts, worldly desires, and ties to family (both living and dead) in order to put their hands to the “gospel plow.”

In order to follow Him, His disciples needed to be like Him. In the final days of His life, He issued two simple commands to them: “come” and “go.” First, he commanded, “Come, be my disciple” (Luke 9:59), encouraging them to imitate His example of resolve.  Next, he challenged them, saying, “Go now, and remember that I am sending you out as lambs among wolves” (Luke 10:3). The disciples were given clear instruction to waste no time on greetings along the way or in lingering in towns that rejected the gospel message.

Time is of the essence when the harvest is ripe and a storm is approaching. Similarly, there is a spiritual harvest of souls waiting to be reaped. We must leave behind earthly distractions and work passionately for God, like Jesus did, recognizing that “there is little time left before the night falls and all work comes to an end” (John 9:4).

The Law commanded, “Do not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together” (Deuteronomy 22:10). If you hook up to the gospel plow, don’t mix with the wrong company. Be single-minded and resolute, straining “to reach the end of the race and receive the prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us up to heaven” (Philippians 3:14)."
04-03,04-03,93,"The man wanted to justify his actions, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” ",Luke 10:29,"As used in this context, your neighbor means “someone near.” God has positioned near us all kinds of people with all kinds of needs. By showing love and generosity to such people, we are fulfilling one of the greatest commandments.

The children of Israel were told to treat a runaway slave as a neighbor and to give him refuge (Deuteronomy 23:15). They were also told not to barge into a neighbor’s house to take an article for collateral. They were to let the person bring it out to them, and if the neighbor was poor and had only a cloak for collateral, they could not keep it overnight. In addition, they were told to leave intentional harvests of wheat, olives, and grapes for the poor (Deuteronomy 24:10-13,19-21).

The generosity of the Good Samaritan to his “neighbor,” someone who was near, distinguished his true religion from the selfish religion of the Levite and priest (Luke 10:25-35). Likewise, Jesus’ commandment to us is “Now go and do the same” (v. 37).

We complicate our religion when we think of it as distant and difficult. In fact, it is near—as near as a neighbor in need. If we focus our love and generosity on neighbors in need, God will meet our own needs in return."
04-04,04-04,94,"But the Lord said to her, “My dear Martha, you are so upset over all these details! There is really only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it—and I won’t take it away from her.” ",Luke 10:41-42,"Love for a neighbor is always measured (as it was in the story of the Good Samaritan) in practical ways. Love for God, however, is often measured in impractical ways. In Martha’s opinion, Mary was wasting her time sitting at the Lord’s feet while the details in the kitchen required her attention (Luke 10:39-40). The woman who lavished her ointment on the head of Jesus was also accused of being impractical and of wasting money (Matthew 26:7-9).

We show our love for people by service. We show our love for God by worship. One who worships does not count the pennies or the hours but sees only the immense value of the Person he is worshiping. To the outside world, which measures everything by its efficiency, these dollars and hours seem wasteful. But to those who love God from their hearts, the money and time expended are only a trifling pittance.

When it comes to loving people, we must be very practical, but when it comes to worshiping God, we must lay aside our desire to be busy. In our love for God, let us detach ourselves from an earthly mentality. Even if our practical, reasoning side says, “You’re being wasteful,” let’s lavish our time and money upon the Lord in true worship."
04-05,04-05,95,"The Lord will conquer your enemies when they attack you. They will attack you from one direction, but they will scatter from you in seven! ",Deuteronomy 28:7,"Power over the enemy is a sign of God’s blessing upon a person’s life. In contrast, Jesus said that a man who had no blessing in his life would be attacked by seven other spirits more evil than the first spirit (Luke 11:26). In the absence of the blessing of God, demons rush in “to steal and kill and destroy” (John 10:10). In every area of life—financial, physical, mental, and marital—these demons will run roughshod and wreak havoc to their hearts’ content.

No blessing . . . no protection! Without God’s blessing, Israel could expect continual shortfalls, diseases, plagues, depression, anxiety, and broken families. However, with God’s blessing, no enemy could affect Israel and no lack could come near God’s people.

Because we are the blessed, let us march triumphantly against our enemies and watch them flee. “When the Red Sea saw you, O God, its waters looked and trembled! The sea quaked to its very depths” (Psalm 77:16). Demons always tremble when God begins to march! In seven directions they flee in terror; therefore, “resist the devil, and he will flee from you” (James 4:7 NIV)."
04-06,04-06,96,"The Lord made this covenant with you so that no man, woman, family, or tribe among you would turn away from the Lord our God to worship these gods of other nations, and so that no root among you would bear bitter and poisonous fruit. ",Deuteronomy 29:18,"The Pharisees were bitter men, envious of Jesus and angry about His pure, sweet teaching. A root of bitterness will corrupt many (Hebrews 12:15). A fountain cannot produce sweet and bitter water at the same time (James 3:11), and a person’s heart is the wellspring of his life.

The secret to life, prosperity, and blessing is a heart that is pure, sweet, and undefiled. How quickly the envy and greed of the world can turn someone’s heart bitter and sour toward individuals or races! Moses warned the Israelites that if they harbored poisonous roots of bitterness in their hearts toward God or one another, their land would become a burning waste of salt and sulfur. The Israelites failed to heed the warning, however, and for forty years were bitter at God, Moses, and one another. Consequently, one by one their corpses fell in the wilderness.

Bitterness is a taste in your mouth—a flavor that colors every experience and relationship. If any bitter roots are lodged in your heart today, ask the Holy Spirit to pull them out. In so doing, you are choosing life, “that you and your descendants might live!” (Deuteronomy 30:19)."
04-07,04-07,97,"Then they remembered that God was their rock, that their redeemer was the Most High. ",Psalm 78:35,"Moses’ song was intended to remind the Israelites that if they backslid, they would be neglecting the Rock who fathered them and the God who had given them birth (Deuteronomy 32:18). That Rock, who is Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4), had followed them in the wilderness and provided drink for them for forty years. How could they ever have turned their backs on their Rock? Perhaps the Israelites took God for granted, thinking they could provide for and defend themselves without His help.

Our lives are confused and insecure when we leave our Rock in order to build our lives on shifting sand (Matthew 7:26-27). The rich fool thought he was secure in his barns and possessions, but he found out that his life was built on a false foundation (Luke 12:16-21). We can look high and low, trying to find security in money, positions, organizations, and even nations. Unfortunately, we will find that all these things will eventually crumble and turn to dust.

Although the world puts its trust in things and people that disappoint, decide today to seek the immovable Rock of the Kingdom of God. “He will give you all you need from day to day if you make the Kingdom of God your primary concern” (Luke 12:31)."
04-08,04-08,98,Work hard and become a leader; be lazy and become a slave. ,Proverbs 12:24,"The Kingdom of God does not belong to the slothful and careless. Jesus taught that the person who is a “faithful, sensible servant” (Luke 12:42) will be amply rewarded for his diligence when the master returns.

All your time, money, talents, and influence have been given to you as tests of your faithfulness. You are tested on earth so your eternal position may be fairly and justly assigned. It really doesn’t matter how high or low your station in life or how much earthly wealth you attain. It matters only how faithful you are in that station and with the wealth you have been given.

Whatever your status, be diligent (hardworking, persevering, and careful in work), making the most with even a little. The more faithful you are with a little, the more God can entrust to you. Sometimes He is watching to see what you will do with a little before He gives you much.

“Laziness ends in slave labor” (Proverbs 12:24 NIV), but diligence brings reward. In eternity, your reward for diligence will be to rule over entire cities (Luke 19:17). So persevere! Be faithful in little and God will reward you with much!"
04-09,04-09,99,"How blessed you are, O Israel! Who else is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is your protecting shield and your triumphant sword! Your enemies will bow low before you, and you will trample on their backs! ",Deuteronomy 33:29,"Moses gave his final blessing upon God’s people, and we, the children of Abraham, can lay claim by faith to the rich pronouncements found in Deuteronomy 33.

First, God promised that His people would “dwell between His shoulders” in security (Deuteronomy 33:12 KJV). There is no greater security and protection than in riding on the back of the Lord!

Next, He said His children would enjoy “the best gifts of the earth and its fullness” (v. 16). Because God made the earth, He can certainly cause it to yield its best for His own.

In addition, He promised His people physical strength for their entire lives (v. 25). Jesus offered this same promise to another child of Abraham hundreds of years later: “Wasn’t it necessary for me, even on the Sabbath day, to free this dear woman from the bondage in which Satan has held her for eighteen years?” (Luke 13:16). Healing and strength are part of the blessing of the Lord.

Finally, He promised His children the peace and security of the everlasting arms underneath them (Deuteronomy 33:27). Security in an insecure world is priceless, and it belongs to us. Let’s lay claim to our blessings, for we are people saved by the Lord (Deuteronomy 33:29)."
04-10,04-10,100,"Be strong and courageous, for you will lead my people to possess all the land I swore to give their ancestors. ",Joshua 1:6,"Fear and timidity cripple and paralyze. Three times the Lord told Joshua to be strong and courageous (Joshua 1:6-7, 9). Even Joshua’s own people echoed God’s encouragement to him (v. 18). God cannot use timid, fearful vessels to accomplish the mighty conquests He envisions for His people.

How helpful it would be if we could only see that our enemies are melting in fear because of us (2:9)! If we could take a peek at the enemy’s camp, we would see how fearful they are of those who are in Christ. Gideon was privileged to see this when he crept down to the enemy’s camp and found the soldiers so frightened that they were dreaming about Gideon’s might against them (Judges 7:13-14).

Satan always tries to intimidate before the battle begins. When the Pharisees tried to frighten Jesus regarding Herod, Jesus replied, “Go tell that fox that . . . I will accomplish my purpose” (Luke 13:32). Nothing could deter Him from His purpose because He knew the power resident in Him.

When the enemy threatens and intimidates, arise in courage and boldness and go forward. Remember: Satan knows what the Lord has planned for us. “I promise you what I promised Moses: ‘Everywhere you go, you will be on land I have given you’ ” (Joshua 1:3). Be strong!"
04-11,04-11,101,"Please listen, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Israel like a flock. O God, enthroned above the cherubim, display your radiant glory to Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Show us your mighty power. Come to rescue us! ",Psalm 80:1-2,"The most powerful illustration of God’s presence going before His people is that of the Israelites as they crossed the Jordan with the ark of the covenant leading them. The ark represented God’s throne, His power, and His might. It went ahead of Israel into the battle at Jericho and brought the Israelites victory. Indeed, if the ark had not gone before them, they would have been on their own.

Whatever impossible circumstance may stand before you will surely be defeated as God’s presence arrives in the battle. Joshua 3:13 says that when the feet of the priests who carried the ark touched the water, the flow of water was cut off upstream and the river piled up there in a heap.

As you come to your “Jordan,” set your foot into the water. How dare the proud waters defy God’s presence and power! The foot of faith carries the arm of omnipotence. One little step of faith releases all the power of God into your situation. Let God’s face shine against the darkness!"
04-12,04-12,102,"This is a true saying, and everyone should believe it: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—and I was the worst of them all. ",1 Timothy 1:15,"Paul’s teaching about sinners focuses on God’s real purpose in sending Jesus: to save those who are lost. Miserable, undone sinners are “the stuff” from which Jesus makes miracles. Often the lower a sinner sinks, the greater the glory God receives when the sinner repents.

Rahab, the prostitute in Jericho, was probably the lowest social outcast in the city (Joshua 6:17). However, God was willing to spare her and her entire family because she was repentant. In God’s sovereign choice to use her, Rahab first was spared from destruction. Then she actually became one of the four women mentioned in Matthew 1 as a direct ancestor of King David and Jesus Christ Himself (v. 5).

Can you see how God loves to take the “things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all . . . to bring to nothing what the world considers important, so that no one can ever boast in the presence of God” (1 Corinthians 1:28-29)? He will run to meet any sinner who comes to his senses and returns to Him saying, “Father, I have sinned” (Luke 15:21). Let us rejoice with the angels today over even one sinner who repents!"
04-13,04-13,103,"For the love of money is at the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows. ",1 Timothy 6:10,"Money tests our hearts, our motives, and our character. What we do with it will prove to God whether He can entrust us with the “true riches of heaven” spoken of in Luke 16:11. The spirit of covetousness ruled the Pharisees. The Lord warned them that they could not “serve both God and money” (v. 13), but verse 14 says they “dearly loved their money,” ignoring the Lord’s stern admonition to them.

The principle of covetousness is immortalized in the story of Achan in the Old Testament. God gave explicit instructions to Joshua that no one was to touch anything of value in Jericho. The entire city was God’s, dedicated to Him as the holy firstfruits of the Canaan conquest. Achan’s hand, however, could not resist grasping a bar of gold, coins of silver, and a beautiful Babylonian coat. His sin followed a familiar pattern: “I saw . . . I wanted . . . I took them . . . They are hidden” (Joshua 7:21).

Our eyes can look enviously on things that do not belong to us, and covetousness can lead us to “take” and “hide” that which is not ours. How much better to follow the wisdom of Luke 16:9: “I tell you, use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. In this way, your generosity stores up a reward for you in heaven.”

Use worldly wealth; don’t let it use you!"
04-14,04-14,104,"“Come,” they say, “let us wipe out Israel as a nation. We will destroy the very memory of its existence.” ",Psalm 83:4,"Satan forms alliances with those who desire to “take possession of the pasturelands of God” (Psalm 83:12 NIV). Joshua and his forces faced enemies who united in one common pursuit: to extinguish the light of God’s people from the face of the earth (Joshua 10:3-4). Though our enemies join forces to destroy us, they are still no match for our God.

In incredible fashion, God loosed the destructive forces of nature against Israel’s enemies. First, He threw hailstones from heaven to smite the Amorites. Then, as though the enemy could have escaped such destruction, God actually stopped the sun and moon for the better part of an entire day to provide enough light for Israel to pursue the fleeing armies (Joshua 10:11-14).

There is no stopping our Commander-in-Chief. The Lord will make our enemies blow away “like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind” (Psalm 83:13)! Have you ever watched the whirling dust of a dust storm? It flies so fast that it only touches the ground occasionally. Pursue your enemies; God will “blow them away.” Though they have declared war on God, they are no match for His anger. Remember: He is the “Most High, supreme over all the earth” (v. 18)."
04-15,04-15,105,"How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty. . . . Even the sparrow finds a home there, and the swallow builds her nest and raises her young—at a place near your altar, O Lord Almighty, my King and my God! ","Psalm 84:1, 3","Everyone, no matter how small or insignificant, can be included in God’s house. Can you imagine God taking time to record that He is concerned about a swallow’s having a place to nest in His house? God’s house is big and wide. It has room for anyone who desires to come under His shadow and eat from His table. And the fare in God’s house is delightful!

Psalm 84 says that the people in God’s house are always praising Him (v. 4). They are always full of strength (v. 7), drawing fresh energy like a tree planted by the waters. Their prayers are always heard (v. 8) because they are so close to Him that praying is as natural as breathing. Furthermore, their needs are always met (v. 11).

Luke 17:15-16 tells us how the lowly Samaritan leper found a place in God’s house. Being a foreigner, he was not allowed to enter the earthly temple and show himself to the priest. Instead, he found an even better place at the feet of Jesus, the High Priest over the house of God.

Come in and dwell in the courts of the Lord. The door is open, and there will always be a place for you!"
04-16,04-16,106,"So that day Moses promised [Caleb], “The land of Canaan on which you were just walking will be your special possession and that of your descendants forever, because you wholeheartedly followed the Lord my God.” ",Joshua 14:9,"Caleb was a man of unrelenting pursuit. His eyes had seen a mountain, and Moses had given him a promise. Although he was now eighty-five years old, his resolve and desire to possess the promise were undiminished. He said to Joshua, “So I’m asking you to give me the hill country that the Lord promised me” (Joshua 14:12). Then this elderly man of faith promptly went in and drove out the giants who lived there!

Forty-five years of waiting did nothing to daunt this man’s purposes in God. How often do we “circle the mountain” one time and then decide it is not the will of God for us to receive what we need? In many instances recorded in the Bible, people of faith had to persevere in order to receive the promise. For example, Elijah prayed seven times before he saw the cloud of rain, and Joshua marched seven days until the walls of Jericho toppled.

In the parable of the importuning widow (Luke 18:5), Jesus taught the importance of persistence. If an unjust judge would eventually grant the request of a persistent widow, how much more will a compassionate God answer the prayers of His righteous saints?

Pursue your dream. And until the dream comes to pass, continue to proclaim, “Give me this hill country!”"
04-17,04-17,107,"Be merciful, O Lord, for I am calling on you constantly. Give me happiness, O Lord, for my life depends on you. ",Psalm 86:3-4,"Like Caleb, Bartimaeus was a man of persistence. He refused to stop calling out for mercy even when others demanded that he be quiet (Luke 18:39). He knew that Jesus was “so good, so ready to forgive, so full of unfailing love” (Psalm 86:5) to all who called on His name.

To get the attention of this God of mercy, your call of faith must never grow weary but must remain fervent. Something about seriousness attracts God’s compassion. A halfhearted request may impress the world, but God knows when you have reached a place of desperation.

Bartimaeus was tired of blindness and cared nothing about public opinion. His fervent pleading drew the attention of the Son of God, and his miracle brought much glory to God. The woman with the issue of blood showed the same determination when she pressed in to touch the hem of Jesus’ garment.

Remember the words of Psalm 86:17: “Send me a sign of your favor. Then those who hate me will be put to shame, for you, O Lord, help and comfort me.” Keep calling out fervently, for the God of mercy is listening."
04-18,04-18,108,"Then Joshua asked them, “How long are you going to wait before taking possession of the remaining land the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given to you?” ",Joshua 18:3,"Joshua rebuked the seven tribes who had not yet asserted their victory over the Canaanites. Why? Like many of us, they were waiting for God, while in reality God was waiting for them! Joshua’s rebuke to the Israelites was that though God had already given them the land, they refused to pay the price to possess it.

Similarly, the lazy steward of Luke 19:20 demonstrated no initiative to become involved in the risky, dangerous world of investment. He simply took the money his master had given him and hid it away. Though he blamed his master for his lack of effort, the real fault lay with him.

God has given you certain talents and gifts, but He will never force you to use them. Yes, it will cost you something to use your talents, and you may even fail once or twice. You will have to practice, sacrifice, and learn, but you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you (Philippians 4:13).

Step out of the boat and onto the water as Peter did. Your eternal reward depends upon your assertiveness, so stop being passive and go take a few cities!"
04-19,04-19,109,"Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when dreams come true, there is life and joy. ",Proverbs 13:12,"Christ certainly felt the burden of a city that refused His grace (Luke 19:41). Jerusalem had every opportunity to repent, having seen great miracles and having heard the Lord’s greatest sermons. The knowledge that Jerusalem would finally reject and crucify Him caused Jesus to weep over a lost opportunity.

Paul also felt heartsick over Israel’s rejection of the Gospel: “My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I would be willing to be forever cursed—cut off from Christ!—if that would save them” (Romans 9:2-3).

Have you ever thought that a certain person would surely repent after hearing a particular sermon or experiencing an especially painful situation in his life, and yet he did not? Intercession can arise from deferred hope, knowing that God is waiting to bless, but human beings are resisting. The pain and agony of watching others miss God’s best in their lives should be turned into a continual prayer on their behalf.

Keep on standing for your lost loved ones. As long as they are alive and breathing, there is still hope. Imagine the joy you will experience when they turn their lives over to God!"
04-20,04-20,110,The stone rejected by the builders has now become the cornerstone. ,Luke 20:17,"Jesus is the Cornerstone. A cornerstone is a large, immovable stone that sets the direction for an entire building. Trying to test and move Jesus by questions and tricks was impossible—a point the Pharisees amply proved. He is unchangeable Truth, the Rock of integrity and honesty. If you try to move Him or persuade Him to change His standard, you will be crushed (v. 18) as that Stone falls on you. You can’t go around Him, under Him, or over Him.

Proverbs 13:15 says, “A person with good sense is respected; a treacherous person walks a rocky road.” Being treacherous means you’re trying to push God’s truth out of your life! Why not build on the truth rather than trying to budge it? Don’t alter it, try to move it, or break it. Fall upon that Stone and let Him break your will to pieces. Then allow the Holy Spirit to build your life upon the foundation of eternal truth.

Align the walls of your life to match the direction of the Cornerstone. A life built upon His truth will last for all eternity. He will never change. Isn’t it time you did?"
04-21,04-21,111,"I have allotted to you as an inheritance all the land of the nations yet unconquered, as well as the land of those we have already conquered—from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. ",Joshua 23:4,"Although the Israelites had been granted the victory, it still took them a long time to subdue their enemies. “Little by little” and “inch by inch” is the pattern for gaining the territory promised to you. Sometimes your progress may be very slow, but you must fight on because every enemy you leave in your territory will become “a pain in your side and a thorn in your eyes” (Joshua 23:13).

Christ Himself is now seated at the right hand of God until He makes your enemies a footstool for your feet (Luke 20:43). Though the battle may be long, you are assured a victory in the end: “Each one of you will put to flight a thousand of the enemy, for the Lord your God fights for you, just as he has promised” (Joshua 23:10). Fight on until every promise from God comes true, for surely the enemy who contests you is trying to resist the Word of God. The promise in Psalm 89:23 is clear: “I will beat down his adversaries before him and destroy those who hate him.”

In the midst of the long battle, remember that your character is being transformed. “Count it all joy” . . . your patience is growing (James 1:2 KJV)!"
04-22,04-22,112,And Jerusalem will be conquered and trampled down by the Gentiles until the age of the Gentiles comes to an end. ,Luke 21:24,"Jesus saw a terrible scene coming to Jerusalem in the not-too-distant future. He saw the Roman legions invading Jerusalem and completely destroying it in A.D. 70. Josephus, the Jewish historian, reported that more than one million Jews died during this invasion, thousands of them by crucifixion outside of Jerusalem. The city was so leveled that a plow was pulled across it from side to side. David also foretold this horrible event: “You have renounced your covenant with him, for you have thrown his crown in the dust. You have broken down the walls protecting him and laid in ruins every fort defending him” (Psalm 89:39-40).

The price for rejecting truth is high, and history, unfortunately, is strewn with the wreckage of civilizations that did just that. Joshua told the Israelites that if they forsook the Lord, He would turn against them, bring disaster on them, and make an end of them (Joshua 24:20). God gives a season of opportunity to repent, but then, like a potter fashioning his pot, He destroys the vessel and makes another.

Determine to be like Joshua, who said, “But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord” (Joshua 24:15). History will prove you right!"
04-23,04-23,113,You spread out our sins before you—our secret sins—and you see them all. ,Psalm 90:8,"Secret sins will always be exposed in the light of God’s presence. Judas thought he would make a profit by selling the knowledge of Christ’s whereabouts for thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26:14-16).

The sin of the love of money (1 Timothy 6:10) has deceived millions into living only for this life. Moses instructed Israel, “Teach us to make the most of our time, so that we may grow in wisdom” (Psalm 90:12). A person who makes the most of his time understands the brevity of life. That person knows that soon our days, like our money, will be expended.

What are thirty pieces of silver in the light of eternity? Where is Judas’s money now? After Judas threw it into the temple, the priests collected it and used it to buy the field where Judas hanged himself. Where is Ananias and Sapphira’s money? Their greed bought them an early death (Acts 5). Where is Felix’s money? Felix kept asking Paul to come and speak to him in hopes of getting a bribe, but he never succeeded (Acts 24:26).

We must be so careful to keep our financial dealings open, clean, and eternal in value. The truth is, eighty years of life is not a very long time (Psalm 90:10)."
04-24,04-24,114,The Lord left certain nations in the land to test those Israelites who had not participated in the wars of Canaan. He did this to teach warfare to generations of Israelites who had no experience in battle. ,Judges 3:1-2,"We all have to face battles and trials. No one else can pass through our trials for us. The hour will surely come when we must face the enemy for ourselves. Parents, pastors, and counselors may shield us from warfare for a season, but the day will come when God allows us to walk into the battle alone. He does this so that we can testify of His faithfulness—a faithfulness that we have personally observed. Another reason He allows us to face the enemy is to see whether we will obey His commands (Judges 3:4).

Peter discovered that he had more “mouth” than “might” (Luke 22:33). As long as Jesus was around, he could really talk a good battle. However, the moment Jesus was gone, Peter denied that he even knew the Lord!

Your first “solo battle” may be a little shaky, and you may even fail. But take your licks, learn from the battle, and rejoice that the battle belongs to the Lord (1 Samuel 17:47)."
04-25,04-25,115,"Who will protect me from the wicked? Who will stand up for me against evildoers? Unless the Lord had helped me, I would soon have died. ",Psalm 94:16-17,"“Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?” This is a simple question, but God truly has a difficult time finding even one man who will be the first to take a stand against evil and injustice.

Deborah waited for Barak to have the courage to stand up against the evil oppression of Jabin and Sisera (Judges 4). Often we cry to God for relief from the enemy, but God is waiting for us to arise and get involved in the spiritual warfare. Deborah blessed those who took the lead and willingly offered themselves (5:2). In that crucial moment when God was delivering their enemy into their hands, some, like the Reubenites, stood back. Because they were so interested in their sheep, they were very indecisive. All they had was “great searchings of heart”

(5:16 KJV), but no action.

It is easy to remain seated in our comfort zones and analyze why we should let someone else fight the Lord’s battles. Today is the day God is defeating our enemies. Who among us will rise up first?"
04-26,04-26,116,"A servant girl noticed him in the firelight and began staring at him. Finally she said, “This man was one of Jesus’ followers!” Peter denied it. “Woman,” he said, “I don’t even know the man!” ",Luke 22:56-57,"Peter denied his identity when confronted about being a disciple of Christ. Jesus, on the other hand, boldly stood and declared His identity to the Sanhedrin: “You are right in saying that I am [the Son of God]” (Luke 22:70).

Gideon went through the process of learning boldness in his identity with God. “The angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, ‘Mighty hero, the Lord is with you!’ ” (Judges 6:12). Just three verses later, Gideon replied, “But Lord . . . how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family!” (v. 15). Gideon’s natural inclination was to hide in the winepress, but his spiritual identity was that of a deliverer. After the test with the fleeces, he began to believe the report of the angel about himself. Gradually, Gideon realized that when God was with him, he could accomplish the impossible.

Stop looking at your old identity of weakness and fear. Believe that God has called and equipped you to win your battles. Fear and timidity are just weapons the enemy uses to intimidate you. Boldly confess to the world, to the devil, and to yourself: “I am who He says I am!”"
04-27,04-27,117,"For the Lord is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice, and the nations with fairness. ",Psalm 98:9,"Essential to the most basic faith in God is the belief that He is coming. From the time of Enoch, who Genesis 5:22 declares lived “in close fellowship with God,” faithful believers have understood that He is coming to judge everyone (Jude 14-15). The thief on the cross was saved just by saying, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom” (Luke 23:42).

The Lord will return suddenly and swiftly to judge the ungodly. Just as Gideon descended with a trumpet blast in the night in sudden judgment upon Midian (Judges 7:19), Jesus will suddenly return with His saints to judge the world. If you are “faint, yet pursuing”

(8:4 KJV), keep up the fight. Your blessed hope as a believer is that the Lord will return not only to deliver you from this world but also to punish His enemies who have afflicted you.

Paul reminded the Philippian believers that “we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior (Philippians 3:20). . . . Remember, the Lord is coming soon” (4:5). One day the Lord will descend from heaven, and our battle will be eternally over!"
04-28,04-28,118,The Lord is king! Let the nations tremble! He sits on his throne between the cherubim. Let the whole earth quake! ,Psalm 99:1,"The prayer of the psalmist for God to come and change the world was a bold one. The closing hours of Jesus’ life epitomized the answer to David’s prayers. Jesus’ slow and agonizing death on the cross caused the earth to convulse and quake. Even the sun refused to shine. The presence of the Lord was so awesome that the elements He had created were unable to function normally.

Even the guards shook when the Lord of Life came out of the tomb (Matthew 28:4). Mighty angels confronted the women who had come to anoint Jesus’ body, and Luke 24:5 says, “The women were terrified and bowed low before them.”

Who can stand in the presence of almighty God? His presence will shake anything and everything until all creation acknowledges that “the Lord reigns” (Psalm 99:1 NIV). When God came down on Mount Sinai, the earth and mountain began to quake and shake violently, and the mountain was engulfed in fire and smoke (Exodus 19:18).

God’s kingdom is the only kingdom that cannot be shaken or destroyed (Hebrews 12:28). Let the nations tremble under the Lordship of Christ. If the earth now shakes in His absence, what will it do when He personally appears?"
04-29,04-29,119,"Gaal was standing at the city gates when Abimelech and his army came out of hiding. When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, there are people coming down from the hilltops!” Zebul replied, “It’s just the shadows of the hills that look like men.” ",Judges 9:35-36,"Satan’s primary objective is to blind our eyes to the truth. Gaal could clearly see people attacking the city, but Zebul implied, “I know you see what you think you see, but what you see is not what you think!”

How does Satan work? He tries to get us to deny the reality of what we see about sin until it is too late. Once the deception is complete and it is too late to reverse it, he says to us, “Now where is that big mouth of yours? . . . Go out and fight them!” (Judges 9:38). Satan will mock for eternity those in hell that were deceived by him.

Jesus, on the other hand, is in the business of opening our minds. For the eleven disciples, He “opened their minds to understand” the Scriptures (Luke 24:45). When Jesus opens our eyes, we begin to recognize the dangers we did not even see before. “There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death” (Proverbs 14:12). Lord, give us eyes to see!"
04-30,04-30,120,"Even in his own land and among his own people, he was not accepted. ",John 1:11,"Rejection cuts deeply into the soul of man. To be rejected by one’s own family and others can wound a person to the very core. Jephthah, son of a prostitute, knew what it was like to be rejected (Judges 11:2). His half brothers sent him away to the land of Tob simply because of his background. He had done nothing to deserve such rejection.

Often we are rejected because of factors beyond our control. Nevertheless, the pain of rejection makes us lash out at those who have hurt us, especially when they reach out to us for help later on. Our response is frequently like Jephthah’s: “Why do you come to me now, when you’re in trouble?” (Judges 11:7).

Jesus Christ knew the pain of rejection to the fullest. The entire nation turned its back on Him, for He was “despised and rejected—a man of sorrows, acquainted with bitterest grief” (Isaiah 53:3).

Have you ever come to your friends or family with a loving witness, only to have it flung back into your face? Love them anyway. One day, like Jephthah’s brethren, they will come knocking on your door. When they do, give them a glimpse of the love of Christ in you."
05-01,05-01,121,. . . The Spirit of the Lord began to take hold of him. ,Judges 13:25,"Samson’s whole ministry resulted from the Holy Spirit’s coming upon him in power (Judges 14:19). Without that power, he was weak and insignificant. Jesus’ ministry also began with the power He received from His baptism in the Holy Spirit (John 1:32). How dare we think that we can enter ministry and be effective for God without the same power released in us! If the Son of God never performed a miracle or preached a sermon without that power, we certainly should wait upon the Lord for it as well.

All ministry has its basis in the Person and power of the Holy Spirit as He enters our lives and brings us into a deeper dimension. The Holy Spirit stirred Samson. This stirring literally means “to agitate,” “to trouble,” and “to move.” Samson was moved from the normal pattern of life and into the role of delivering Israel from the Philistines. The inward stirring and agitation of God against the oppression of the enemy is where the power of God is released. Allow the Holy Spirit to come upon you now and stir you to fulfill your destiny!"
05-02,05-02,122,He picked up a donkey’s jawbone that was lying on the ground and killed a thousand Philistines with it. ,Judges 15:15,"Often we become so caught up in working for God that we fail to be refreshed by God. Samson killed a thousand men with a don-key’s jawbone. What a wonderful feat! However, in spite of this accomplishment, he cried out, “Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of these pagan people?” (v. 18). In other words, Samson had worked hard for God, but now he needed refreshing.

You may be mightily used of God in deliverance and yet be perishing from spiritual thirst. A burned-out minister is worthless to the Lord, regardless of his ministerial abilities. But God will hear your cry, like He did Samson’s, and open up a supernatural spring for you. Verse 19 says, “Samson was revived as he drank.” The psalmist said, “He fills my life with good things. My youth is renewed like the eagle’s!” (Psalm 103:5). Refreshing and renewal take place whenever you bless the Lord with all your soul.

Elijah killed the prophets of Baal and then was ready the next day to die and go to heaven. What is the secret of longevity in ministry and spiritual service? Lay down the “jawbone” every evening. Don’t pick it up again the next day until you have been to the refreshing fountain of worship!"
05-03,05-03,123,"So Micah ordained the Levite as his personal priest, and he lived in Micah’s house. “I know the Lord will bless me now,” Micah said, “because I have a Levite serving as my priest.” ",Judges 17:12-13,"How easily the flesh can concoct a religious scheme that appears to please God but in reality is a foolish spectacle! The Levite left the proper place of worship at the tabernacle and went out as a hired “priest” for an idol worshiper.

Religion drifts away from God and toward idolatry because of the love of power and money. The further religion deviates from God’s Word, the more accepted it is by society. Flesh gives birth to flesh, and soon a system of religion is developed that has nothing to do with the Word of God. “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (John 3:6 KJV).

Jesus taught Nicodemus that knowing God was as simple as the Holy Spirit’s giving him a new birth (v. 8). Yet Nicodemus, in his human mind, wanted to make it more complicated. Our minds long to do something religious to earn salvation. If earning salvation is hard, you can be sure it’s the plan of man. If it is simple, it’s the truth of God.

Everyone can easily receive God’s salvation, for it is available to all. Don’t try to find God with your natural mind. Instead, follow the way of the Spirit!"
05-04,05-04,124,"So they went out to fight against the warriors of Benjamin, but the men of Benjamin killed another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of whom were experienced with a sword. ",Judges 20:24-25,"Is it possible to be doing the right thing and still seem to be losing the battle? The Lord himself had commissioned the men of Israel, saying, “Go out and fight against them” (Judges 20:23). The Israelites’ battle was in retaliation for Benjamin’s wickedness. You would think that God would have instantly given the Israelites victory. Instead, they were defeated twice before they finally prevailed!

How important it is not to interpret one lost battle as meaning that God is not with you! Satan may win a battle, but he won’t win the war. You are fighting the Lord’s battles, not your own. Casualties often occur in war, but victory is sure to come to the one who keeps inquiring of the Lord. Once, then twice, then a third time, the Israelites regrouped and sought the Lord. They knew their cause was just and that the war was not over until they had won.

Never doubt in the darkness what God told you in the light. If God told you to do something for Him, it will succeed. He knows the enemy’s strategy and will give you the victory in the end!"
05-05,05-05,125,"A truthful witness saves lives, but a false witness is a traitor. ",Proverbs 14:25,"The truth of this verse is illustrated in the lives of two women, Naomi and Ruth, who were delivered from spiritual darkness. In spite of all her problems, Naomi directed Ruth toward following the true and living God (Ruth 1:22). Naomi was a real witness to Ruth, because a true witness is always kind to the outcasts.

Ruth was a Moabitess, and God had cursed her people for fighting against Moses. As a result, they could not enter the house of God until the tenth generation (Deuteronomy 23:3). Naomi’s witness to Ruth ultimately led to Ruth’s marriage into the ancestral line of Jesus. The “outcast” became a “princess”!

Jesus was a truthful witness in His discussion with the woman at the well. He told her that she needed to repent of her five marriages and present adulterous relationship (John 4:18). Others may have talked about her, but only Jesus was truthful with her. His simple statement of truth set her free, and she received the Living Water.

Let us spend our lives harvesting a spiritual crop for eternal life. There are endless fields of souls needing to hear the truth, and they are “ready now for the harvest” (John 4:35)."
05-06,05-06,126,"And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. ",Ruth 2:16 KJV,"What would we do without the “handfuls of purpose,” which the Lord of the harvest intentionally leaves out for us? If Boaz had not instructed his men to drop some daily provision for Ruth, she and Naomi would have perished.

When our lives seem insignificant and full of drudgery and routine, we must remember that God has things working for us which we never imagined. Just when Ruth’s back felt like it was breaking and her bread bag was empty, she found a generous handful of purpose. Just when we think God has forgotten about us, He drops us a handful of purpose.

Joseph was languishing in an Egyptian prison. It seemed as though God had forgotten him and his life was destined to drudgery and misery. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, God dropped Joseph a handful of purpose in the dream of Pharaoh (Psalm 105:19).

God will drop little signs here and there to remind you of His sovereign direction and destiny for your life. Even in your struggles, all things are working together for good because you are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28). Never forget: “Boaz” has his eyes upon you!"
05-07,05-07,127,"But he brought his people safely out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold; there were no sick or feeble people among them. ",Psalm 105:37,"When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they were all miraculously healed of their infirmities, diseases, and slavery-related injuries. All walked out under their own power, and not a one faltered. Imagine the scope of such a miracle! Just by eating the Passover lamb, a nation of beaten, bruised, malnourished slaves received total, perfect health.

This miracle was a type of the healing purchased at Calvary by the Passover Lamb of God, Jesus Christ. In His ministry, He healed all who desired to be well. Jesus asked the man at the pool of Bethesda, “Would you like to get well?” (John 5:6). The Lord’s healing power was flowing to whoever would reach out and receive it.

Can you see that healing is available to you if you will only receive it? God is no respecter of persons. What He did for Israel, He will do for you. Remember how Hannah’s womb was supernaturally opened to conceive a son because she “asked the Lord for him” (1 Samuel 1:20). Thank Him today, and ask for the healing you need. It belongs to you!"
05-08,05-08,128,"But I will honor only those who honor me, and I will despise those who despise me. ",1 Samuel 2:30,"Eli had a hard time disciplining his sons because he was more concerned about their opinion of him than God’s opinion of him. So God asked him, “Why do you honor your sons more than me—for you and they have become fat from the best offerings of my people!”

(1 Samuel 2:29).

Christians should value God’s Word and His opinion far more than they value the opinion of man. Jesus rebuked the Jews because they made no effort to obtain the true praise that comes only from God. Instead, they were more concerned about receiving praise from one another (John 5:44).

Someone once said, “Never be concerned about what others think about you, because they don’t think about you!” In reality, most people really think primarily about themselves, and their opinions will not count when you stand before almighty God. The day will come when all men will be silent, and you alone will give an account for your choices and convictions. Where will your fans or critics be then?

If you place God’s opinion above all else, it may cost you a friend. However, at the final judgment, all eternity will record your integrity before Him. Stand firm in the truth, and honor God above anyone else, even family."
05-09,05-09,129,"Jesus soon saw a great crowd of people climbing the hill, looking for him. Turning to Philip, he asked, “Philip, where can we buy bread to feed all these people?” He was testing Philip, for he already knew what he was going to do. Philip replied, “It would take a small fortune to feed them!” Then Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up. “There’s a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish. . . .” ",John 6:5-9,"Are you a disciple of Philip or a disciple of Andrew? There were obvious differences in their answers when Jesus asked both of them what they should do about the hungry multitude. His question was merely a test of their faith.

Philip saw the facts. His whole perspective was intellectual and negative, without any regard for spiritual vision. Anyone can rehearse the facts to God, but the facts aren’t important to Him—He made the facts! Like Philip, the Israelites tested God’s patience on their journey through the wilderness (Psalm 106:14). They could see only the facts: no food, no water, and no meat. But Jesus was there all the time, ready to provide for whatever needs they had.

Andrew, on the other hand, saw the vision. He had a spiritual and positive perspective that allowed God to work miracles. Jesus is with you in the wilderness, and you, like Andrew, can believe in Him for miracles. He already knows what wonders He wants to perform on your behalf.

Will you be a disciple of Philip or of Andrew?"
05-10,05-10,130,"Samuel was very upset with their request and went to the Lord for advice. “Do as they say,” the Lord replied, “for it is me they are rejecting, not you. They don’t want me to be their king any longer.” ",1 Samuel 8:6-7,"God knows what rejection feels like because it happened to Him! An entire nation chose an earthly king over the privilege of having its government rest upon the shoulders of almighty God. Even in the New Testament, many who followed Jesus did so only for what He gave them to eat (John 6:34). They rejected His identity but wanted whatever benefits they could receive from Him. How that must have hurt Him! To be generous, loving, and giving to people and then be passed over as they choose someone else hurts deeply. The more love and resources we have given, the more it hurts.

Why would anyone embrace a human source and reject God? Jesus told those following Him, “I am the bread of life” (John 6:35). He is our source of acceptance and satisfaction forever. He knows exactly how it feels to be rejected. After a lifetime of love and giving, He was “despised and rejected” (Isaiah 53:3 KJV). When He was on the cross, the crowds mocked Him and turned their backs on Him.

Have you been rejected? Jesus knows the feeling of your infirmities (Hebrews 4:15). Run to Him and let His nail-pierced hands embrace you in perfect acceptance."
05-11,05-11,131,"Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it over Saul’s head. He kissed Saul on the cheek and said, “I am doing this because the Lord has appointed you to be the leader of his people Israel.” ",1 Samuel 10:1,"Samuel’s anointing of Saul provides insight into the nature of God’s anointing. The first thing that happened to Saul was that “God changed his heart” (v. 9). Samuel had told him, “You will be changed into a different person” (v. 6), and that is just what happened. The anointing of God upon your life changes you from “glory to glory” into the image of Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV). Normally, you may be timid, but under the anointing, you will find yourself very bold.

Second, the anointing caused Saul to prophesy and worship (1 Samuel 10:10). The Holy Spirit will help you to worship God with your spirit and not just with your mind. Under the anointing, you might prophesy, like Saul did. Such prophecy comes up out of your spirit and produces a stronger word from God than your intellect could produce.

Finally, the anointing brought Saul a holy anger and power against the works of darkness (1 Samuel 11:6). A righteous indignation rose up within him, and he suddenly challenged the people to follow him to destroy the Ammonites.

Open your spirit today for fresh anointing. Then get ready to move into a new level of change, worship, and power!"
05-12,05-12,132,"Jesus replied, “Now is not the right time for me to go. But you can go anytime, and it will make no difference.” ",John 7:6,"With these words, Jesus addressed His brothers who were pressuring Him to go to Jerusalem and perform miracles. They reasoned that anyone who wanted to be a public figure needed to go to the center of attention and promote himself. In their minds, Jesus had the greatest miracle show going and needed to advertise it!

Jesus countered His brothers’ demands with a reference to His time. He was committed to waiting upon the Lord for the right time with regard to doors of ministry. Many Christians, however, are more like Jesus’ brothers than like Him.  They look at ministry like it’s a business, and they grow frustrated if they or anyone else misses an opportunity.

Saul, too, had no sense of divine timing (1 Samuel 13:11-12). Instead of waiting for Samuel to make the sacrifice, he forced himself to offer it before the people began to scatter. This mistake of timing cost him his throne.

The great eagle digs his claws into the top of the rock and waits for the thermal winds. When they are blowing too hard to resist, he releases his talons and soars. His wings do not flap with exertion, but he effortlessly soars high. Wait for the Lord and His winds of opportunity. He will exalt you when the timing is perfect."
05-13,05-13,133,"Perhaps the Lord will help us, for nothing can hinder the Lord. He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few! ",1 Samuel 14:6,"How much can God do with one person? Very often we know that something should be done, but we are waiting on others to do it. Jonathan and his armor bearer were sitting in an impossible situation, between two steep, sharp, and rocky cliffs (1 Samuel 14:4). They were literally between a rock and a hard place!

While everyone waited on someone else to make a move, Jonathan believed that one plus God is a majority. In essence, He said, “Let’s go! The Lord can take care of us whether we face many or few.” In his impossible situation, Jonathan was confident of God’s saving power.

Verse 15 of 1 Samuel 14 says, “Suddenly, panic broke out in the Philistine army. . . . And just then an earthquake struck, and everyone was terrified.” Who do you think sent the panic and the earthquake in response to Jonathan’s faith? God, of course!

God is really looking for just one person who will step out in faith, and when He finds that person, He starts to move. What if you are that person? Take the first step, make your move, and watch God make His move!"
05-14,05-14,134,"But Samuel replied, “What is more pleasing to the Lord: your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice? Obedience is far better than sacrifice. Listening to him is much better than offering the fat of rams.” ",1 Samuel 15:22,"To obey is better than sacrifice. This simple statement contains the secret to pleasing God. Rebellion began with the devil’s asserting his own will and making his own decisions. Saul’s problems started when he no longer was small in his own eyes but, in pride, began to make decisions apart from God’s will.

Rebellion and arrogance tell us that we know more than God does and that our ways are above His ways. The Lord, however, doesn’t need us to think for Him, but only to carry out what He commands. He found this trait in David, a young shepherd boy who possessed a heart to obey Him fully (1 Samuel 16:7). Because of David’s pure heart, God took the kingdom from Saul and awarded it to David.

Jesus’ life was powerful because He never once asserted His own will. In the wilderness, during His ministry, at Gethsemane, and on the cross, Jesus perfectly obeyed. So, too, does our power with God rest in our obedience to Him. We must always remember this: The important thing is not that we have done something for God, but that we have done what God wanted us to do!"
05-15,05-15,135,"“Don’t worry about a thing,” David told Saul. “I’ll go fight this Philistine!” ",1 Samuel 17:32,"No greater work of the Lord is recorded in the Bible than David’s slaying of Goliath. More than nine feet tall, Goliath presented the most imposing stature of any human being in history. The image of a little stripling boy walking and then running toward such a giant stirs the courage of all who read the tale. Let’s note three of this story’s many lessons.

The first lesson deals with the boldness of a person who is anointed by God. Saul and all his men were scared to death of Goliath, but the young man who had been anointed by God had no sense of fear. He had no concern or worry because his trust was in the God who had always helped him. He boldly proclaimed, “The Lord who saved me from the claws of the lion and the bear will save me from this Philistine!” (1 Samuel 17:37).

The second lesson concerns the methods of God. David refused Saul’s bulky armor, saying only that he felt more comfortable without it. He was choosing God’s methods over the methods of the world. Trust in the things of this world rather than the things of God will never bring success when facing an overwhelming battle.

The third lesson illustrates the works of the Lord. God can take the smallest human weapons and warriors and demolish the mightiest foes. Who would have thought that five stones in the hand of a boy could bring down the mighty Goliath?

Psalm 111:2 reminds us, “How amazing are the deeds of the Lord! All who delight in him should ponder them.” Run boldly toward your “Goliath.” He must come down in the name of the Lord!"
05-16,05-16,136,". . . He was a murderer from the beginning and has always hated the truth. There is no truth in him. When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies. ",John 8:44,"Jesus described the devil as a murderer from the beginning of time, and this description also serves to illustrate the life of King Saul. When an evil spirit came upon Saul to possess him, he was overwhelmed with thoughts of envy and murder toward David. Time after time he tried to destroy David, even attempting to pin him to the wall with a spear (1 Samuel 18:10-11).

Satan is envious of believers because they have replaced him as worshipers and sons of God. His hatred for humankind knows no bounds. He always seeks “to steal and kill and destroy” (John 10:10), and He wants to destroy you!

Jesus said that the devil is a liar and the father of lies. Saul lied to David and told him he wanted to give his older daughter Merab in marriage to him. In fact, he wanted David killed by the Philistines (1 Samuel 18:17). David’s innocence, however, was his protection. The Lord sent the Holy Spirit to knock to the ground the soldiers who chased David. Even Saul himself was knocked to the ground (19:23-24).

Let us rejoice that even though Satan attacks with lies and murderous intents, the Holy Spirit can render our enemies harmless. We will fulfill our purposes in God!"
05-17,05-17,137,"“But what has he done?” Jonathan demanded. “Why should he be put to death?” Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan, intending to kill him. So at last Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David. ",1 Samuel 20:32-33,"Envy blinds us to the truth. Jonathan pleaded with his father to spare David’s life, reminding him that David had done him nothing but good. Totally persuaded that David stood in the way of his son’s ruling Israel, however, Saul cursed and insulted Jonathan.

The Pharisees also were blinded by envy to the reality of the blind man’s healing. They refused to believe that he had ever been blind and then refused to believe that Jesus had performed the miracle. They stubbornly refused to acknowledge that Jesus was anything but a sinner, even if He had performed the miracle (John 9:24). Jesus answered, saying, “I have come to judge the world. I have come to give sight to the blind and to show those who think they see that they are blind” (John 9:39).

You will never convince those who are envious of the work of God that your motives are genuine or that God has truly performed a miracle. They will reason it away, insult you, and may even throw you out (John 9:34). They may remain blind, but one thing you will know: “I was blind, and now I can see!” (v. 25)."
05-18,05-18,138,I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. ,John 10:11,"Jesus taught us that the ultimate act of love is to lay down our lives for others. In fact, Jesus stated, “The Father loves me because I lay down my life that I may have it back again” (John 10:17).

People who consider the needs of others ahead of their own are true shepherds in the spirit of Jesus. On the other hand, people with hireling spirits are concerned only for what relates to their own well-being.

Paul said, “I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare” (Philippians 2:20). The true love of Christ is defined in 1 John 3:16: “We know what real love is because Christ gave up his life for us. And so we also ought to give up our lives for our Christian brothers and sisters.”

Just as David abandoned his own safety and went to rescue Keilah (1 Samuel 23:2), we must abandon our own self-interests and begin to lay down our lives for others. We will not lose our lives; we will take them up again!"
05-19,05-19,139,"The Lord will decide between us. Perhaps the Lord will punish you for what you are trying to do to me, but I will never harm you. ",1 Samuel 24:12,"One of the hardest lessons you may face in life is learning not to avenge yourself. In two separate instances with two different enemies, David demonstrated the importance of not taking revenge. In the cave at En-gedi, David could have killed Saul and been finished with running from him day and night. Instead, David opted against avenging Saul’s evil attempts to destroy him and swore that his hand would never touch Saul.

In another instance in the Old Testament, Abigail intercepted David and persuaded him not to avenge himself upon Nabal. David thanked her for keeping him from shedding blood that day and preventing him from taking revenge with his own hands (1 Samuel 25:33).

How easy it is to take matters into your own hands, even though God has said, “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord” (Romans 12:19 KJV). The devil may have sent someone who is encouraging you to take matters into your own hands, but leave your vengeance in God’s hands. One day you will look up and the “Sauls” and “Nabals” in your life “will disappear like stones shot from a sling!” (1 Samuel 25:29)."
05-20,05-20,140,"Then Jesus shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” And Lazarus came out, bound in graveclothes, his face wrapped in a headcloth. Jesus told them, “Unwrap him and let him go!” ",John 11:43-44,"The world is fascinated with life after death. People spend thousands of dollars consulting psychics, trying to get a message from someone who has died. In 1 Samuel 28 and John 11, two men came back from the dead and had a great impact on those around them. In the first passage, Samuel gave Saul a verdict of judgment and eternal death, reminding us of the reality of eternal punishment. In the second passage, Lazarus’s resurrection gave glory to Jesus, reminding us of the believer’s glorious future.

Every one of us will face the reality of death. We will hear either a final judgment of condemnation for our sin or a message of joy and resurrection life from the Author of Life. Although the world is fascinated with spiritism and contacting the dead, we know that the end of such pursuit is eternal death and judgment. As Christians, however, we understand that Jesus has conquered death, for John 11:25 says,

“Those who believe in me, even though they die like everyone else, will live again.”

Rest secure today in your future after the grave, for He who is the Resurrection and the Life will be waiting for you on the other side!"
05-21,05-21,141,But David found strength in the Lord his God. ,1 Samuel 30:6,"Just when things looked the darkest for David, God was actually giving him the breakthrough. At Ziklag, David faced the lowest point in his life, for he lost his entire family in one day. After this tragedy, even his best friends were ready to stone him. Because he found strength in the Lord, however, God turned the whole situation around.  “David got back everything the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued his two wives. Nothing was missing: small or great, son or daughter, nor anything else that had been taken. David brought everything back” (1 Samuel 30:18-19).

Someone has pointed out that at Ziklag David was only seventy-two hours away from a miracle. Unknown to him, all the years of his running from Saul were about to come to an end. The test was almost over, but the final part of the test was the hardest. But afterward, not only did David recover everything, but he also gained a tremendous amount of wealth. He used that wealth to spread goodwill throughout Judah, and this initiated the process of his becoming king of Judah. What a turnabout from the deep depression of Ziklag!

You may think you have waited forever, but you may be only sev-enty-two hours from your miracle. “When Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes. In fact, the Lord gave him twice as much as before” (Job 42:10). Wait for God to turn your darkness into glorious light!"
05-22,05-22,142,"Jesus replied, “The time has come for the Son of Man to enter into his glory.” ",John 12:23,"Satan may try to delay, hinder, sift, oppose, and confuse, but the moment of your breakthrough must come. Although the hands of a clock move almost imperceptibly, the moment inevitably arrives when the clock strikes the hour. The poet Friedrich von Logau expressed it this way: “Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small; though with patience He stands waiting, with exactness grinds He all.”

Jesus’ thirty-three years of preparation and ministry culminated in the glory of His death and resurrection. In that moment, the prince of this world was cast out (John 12:31). David also experienced tremendous pressure in his years of preparation, but suddenly his hour came, Saul died unexpectedly, and the path to the throne was opened (2 Samuel 2:4).

This is the payoff of years of faithful service to a vision: one day the hour will come. Never try to get ahead of your time, for God knows when the circumstances are ripe and you have been thoroughly prepared. All your trials and difficulties are only the stepping-stones to your glorious destiny: to reign forever with Jesus Christ!"
05-23,05-23,143,"Now Jesus was in great anguish of spirit, and he exclaimed, “The truth is, one of you will betray me!” ",John 13:21,"Betrayal is one of the worst things that can happen to you. To take someone into your inner circle of confidence and then to have him turn upon you hurts worse than any enemy’s attack. Jesus knew intimately this pain of betrayal as He watched Judas walk out into the night to fulfill his wicked plan (John 13:30). David also faced betrayal when his commander-in-chief Joab secretly murdered Abner (2 Samuel 3:27).

When a trusted ally treats you with contempt, you may want to retaliate in anger. David refused to exact revenge upon Joab. He knew Joab would eventually reap the fruit of his betrayal and thus pronounced Joab cursed in all his generations. Jesus turned Judas over to Satan so that Judas would reap the terror of betraying the innocent. Instead of retaliating, Jesus even washed Judas’s feet before Judas left to betray Him! On the cross, Jesus epitomized the essence of true forgiveness when He said, “Father, forgive these people, because they don’t know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34).

Forgive and release your betrayer to God so that He may deal with him. If God is for you, who can ever be against you (Romans 8:31)?"
05-24,05-24,144,"David retorted to Michal, “I was dancing before the Lord, who chose me above your father and his family! He appointed me as the leader of Israel, the people of the Lord. So I am willing to act like a fool in order to show my joy in the Lord.” ",2 Samuel 6:21,"Worship tests our hearts. Nothing is so sacred or special to God as worship, for it is the continual activity around God’s throne.

In 2 Samuel 6, we are confronted with two individuals who came under judgment for worshiping in the wrong way. The lesson of Uzzah

(v. 7) is to maintain reverence in our worship. Flippant, halfhearted, presumptuous worship can result in the judgment of God coming upon our lives. God is long-suffering, but He will not be mocked by open disregard for His honor during our worship.

The lesson of Michal (v. 20) is not to be prideful in our worship. Michal despised David’s true worship, and God’s judgment caused her to remain childless throughout her life. David, however, was a man after God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14) in the way he expressed worship. He was serious and careful in bringing up the ark, yet childlike and undignified in his rejoicing.

Personal dignity is not an issue in heaven where all fall down before the throne in ceaseless praise and worship. One day we will join the angels in heaven in unashamed worship and praise to our God. As you worship Him now on the earth, remember His holiness and His happiness. Go ahead and worship in order and in ardor. God is watching your worship!"
05-25,05-25,145,"And I have provided a permanent homeland for my people Israel, a secure place where they will never be disturbed. ",2 Samuel 7:10,"There is in the heart of all people a desire for a permanent relationship with God and a desire to dwell with Him forever. In this life, we are forever beset with a sense of impermanence, of being absent from the Lord.

Those who love God are running to Him, not from Him! They are looking for a way to dwell with Him. David’s desire to build a house for God reflected his wish to have a permanent home with God. David had such a love for God’s presence that he longed for God to have a permanent residence right next door to his palace. God responded to David’s yearning by saying that He would provide a place for His people and plant them so they could have a home of their own. He also told David that He would build a house for him.

To meet someone is a temporary experience, but to live together with that person implies a permanent relationship. Jesus told His disciples, “All those who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and live with them” (John 14:23).

Settle in today in God’s presence. His desire is to dwell with you forever!"
05-26,05-26,146,"Late one afternoon David got out of bed after taking a nap and went for a stroll on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath. ",2 Samuel 11:2,"In this verse, we can see an example of the three main roots of sin that tempt all men: “the lust for physical pleasure, the lust for everything we see, and pride in our possessions” (1 John 2:16).

Most sin begins with the eyes, just as the first sin entered the world when Eve saw the fruit. Genesis 3:6 says, “The fruit looked so fresh and delicious.” David’s eyes caused him to lust, starting a cycle of violence and anarchy in his kingdom. His lustful eyes brought forth sin, and it cost him many years and much heartache to extricate himself from that sin. David finally said, “I will refuse to look at anything vile and vulgar” (Psalm 101:3). Job, too, echoed this thought when he said, “I made a covenant with my eyes not to look with lust upon a young woman” (Job 31:1).

Sinful living comes with a high price tag. A line from a famous sermon conveys it well: “Sin will take you further than you want to go, keep you longer than you want to stay, and cost you more than you want to pay.” Be ruthless against lustful thoughts and imaginations. You may think the pleasure is great, but the payoff will only bring heartache."
05-27,05-27,147,"And when he comes, he will convince the world of its sin, and of God’s righteousness, and of the coming judgment. ",John 16:8,"Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would convict the world of guilt in regard to sin. Conviction arises from confrontation with evidence. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, and He holds before your conscience the evidence of your sin, leaving you no room for escape.

The prophet Nathan confronted David with a parable that illustrated David’s guilt with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12:7). The simple parable smote his conscience, and David truly repented from his heart. Although his sin was great, he received forgiveness because his repentance was genuine.

When God confronts you with the truth of your sin, He is showing mercy. As Jesus said, “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Never run from the evidence. The Holy Spirit will bring certain scriptures to you as a mirror to show you your true self. If you respond to His mercy and grace, you will be set free from whatever sin has plagued you.

Invite the Holy Spirit to shine the light on the truth of your life and actions. Then honestly accept and admit His evidence, and confess with David, “I have sinned against the Lord” (2 Samuel 12:13). Then, and only then, will you hear Him say, “Yes, but the Lord has forgiven you” (v. 13)."
05-28,05-28,148,"David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. And Amnon, her half brother, fell desperately in love with her. ",2 Samuel 13:1,"Satan is a master at dangling lustful sin in front of us and making it look incredibly enticing. Then, after we reach out and take it, the reality of that sin is a miserable disappointment. How quickly our eyes despise what we have attained through lust!

Satan tempts us with a picture of sin that looks like an oasis in the desert. He makes it seem as though a lust fulfilled will bring the ultimate happiness. Amnon fantasized for a long time about having relations with Tamar. However, the moment he acted upon his fantasy, the imagined sweet taste of it turned to bitterness. Amnon eventually despised what he had conquered (2 Samuel 13:15).

In any temptation, ask God to show you the reality of how disappointing the sin will be. Any move you make because of lust will turn to mock you and will lead you toward even more sin. Ask for the help of the Holy Spirit to break through any fantasy in your mind and to see its backside: anger, disrespect, and even death.

“There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death” (Proverbs 14:12). Don’t fall for Satan’s bait!"
05-29,05-29,149,"Oh, how I love your law! I think about it all day long. ",Psalm 119:97,"Meditation is not the process of clearing your mind, but of filling your mind with truth. It is like a rock displacing water in a vessel. Your mind is exposed continually to the doubt, atrocities, filth, and strife of the world around you. Trying to clear out those thoughts is very difficult, but there is a remedy: meditation upon God’s Word.

It takes a conscious effort to focus your mind and heart upon the truth of God’s Word. Once you do, however, you will reap the benefits. Joshua 1:8 says, “Study this Book of the Law continually. Meditate on it day and night so you may be sure to obey all that is written in it. Only then will you succeed.”

Reading the Bible is good, but meditation is life changing, for it involves thinking about a verse until it drops from your mind into your heart. The root word meditate means “to mutter,” or “to utter.” The more you speak the Word, the more it drops into your spirit. As you go about your daily business, speak the Word to yourself. Continually “mutter” it, mulling it over in your mind.

Whatever your area of need, select several promises that apply to your situation and memorize them. Then meditate on them all day long (Psalm 119:97). When doubt, fear, discouragement, and strife enter your mind, “think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise” (Philippians 4:8). Your faith will grow, your mind will change, and your way will become successful!"
05-30,05-30,150,"Truly, each of your commandments is right. That is why I hate every false way. ",Psalm 119:128,"The psalmist declares a holy revulsion that must dwell in your heart against anything that challenges the law of God. If you consistently struggle to conquer an area of sin in your life, it may be that you do not hate that sin.

One sin God hates is divorce (Malachi 2:16), not because He wants to be legalistic but because He knows the terrible consequences you will suffer from it. Satan’s deception concerning this sin and all sin is so devious and the consequences of disobedience so eternal that you must develop a passion against all sin, for it destroys people’s souls.

Double-minded or undecided people (Psalm 119:113) are those who mix God’s law with their own reasoning, listening to the voice of personal opinion rather than the voice of truth. Such compromisers lead the godly astray and are unstable in all their ways (James 1:8). If you are double-minded, rid yourself of lukewarmness, and purify your heart.

If you don’t hate sin, you will fall into it. Love God and hate sin, and you will always walk in the path of righteousness."
05-31,05-31,151,"When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among the four of them. ",John 19:23,"It seems that God in His foreknowledge was determined to leave Jesus with nothing as He finished the work on the cross. Jesus’ clothes were His last physical possessions upon the earth. As was customary, the soldiers received those for themselves.

Paul said, “You know how full of love and kindness our Lord Jesus Christ was. Though he was very rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty he could make you rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9). Jesus completely emptied Himself of all earthly riches and glory in order to pay the full price for our redemption. How opposite His attitude was from that of a world that struggles to amass wealth and fortune!

Let us live to give. In the short time we are on earth, let us use our worldly possessions as tools to reach the lost. At the moment of death, we will discard all earthly goods, like an animal shedding a worn-out skin. Let’s take a fresh look at our possessions and ask how they can serve to further the Gospel before God calls us home to glory!"
06-01,06-01,152,"While David was sitting at the city gate, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them. ",2 Samuel 18:24,"When grown men run, something urgent has caused them to abandon their usual dignity. Ahimaaz’s zeal to run was inspired by his joy at being the one to report a victory to his king (2 Samuel 18:28). In the New Testament, Peter and John ran at the thought of the resurrection (John 20:4). When we have an important message to deliver, we, too, will run.

When news so wonderful grips the soul, the usual pace of life is interrupted, and a walk becomes a run. Those who do not know the Lord may not understand your zeal to run with the good news of the Gospel, but they do not hesitate to run for what they are excited about. You need to ask God to quicken your pace of testimony, to thrill your heart with His Word so that a walk just won’t do.

If you have lost your zeal, come back to the empty tomb today and look in. Then run to the waiting nations with your report. Remember what Jesus said when He appeared to His disciples following His resurrection: “As the Father has sent me, so I send you” (John 20:21)."
06-02,06-02,153,"“My lord the king, please forgive me,” he pleaded. “Forget the terrible thing I did when you left Jerusalem.” ",2 Samuel 19:19,"The return of the king was a sudden, unanticipated event that radically changed all perspectives. Those who had mocked David as he left Jerusalem now repented, falling prostrate and begging for mercy. Those who had blessed David in his exile were richly rewarded (2 Samuel 19:23) and invited to sit at his table for the rest of their lives. With his return, David held accountable those whose actions were questionable, and the truth was revealed (v. 25).

What a picture this story is of the return of the King of Kings! When Jesus returns, time will stop. One by one, we will each stand before the judgment seat of Christ and give a detailed account of how we have used our time, money, and gifts. We will answer for every wrong thought and attitude of the mind we have harbored.

How foolish it is to waste our lives or brazenly defy the Lordship of Christ as though He will never return! Why not ponder every day what it will be like the moment after the King returns and it is too late to change anything? One day our King will return. That is a sure fact. May you hear Him say, “Well done, my good and faithful servant” (Matthew 25:21)."
06-03,06-03,154,"There was a famine during David’s reign that lasted for three years, so David asked the Lord about it. And the Lord said, “The famine has come because Saul and his family are guilty of murdering the Gibeonites.” ",2 Samuel 21:1,"We must take care of unfinished business. God is a God of justice and cannot overlook the horrible reality of sin. Saul killed people with whom Israel had pledged a covenant in the days of Joshua. Though Saul viewed the killings as justifiable, the victims’ innocent blood cried out before God, demanding justice. The heavens remained as brass for David and Israel until they dealt with and atoned for Saul’s actions.

Many things occur in societies because God is avenging past actions and atrocities that were leveled against innocent people. What generational curses have fallen upon our cities and nations because of the past sins of our fathers?

In 2 Samuel 24, we see that God was so serious about justice that seventy thousand people died to appease His wrath (v. 15). We must be serious enough about sins against others to cry out in repentance, approach the offended, and make reconciliation. These actions, as simple as they may seem, will release the blessing of God. As David did, we must help restore and heal the breaches of the past, because after he had made restitution, “the Lord answered his prayer” (v. 25)."
06-04,06-04,155,He prepares me for battle; he strengthens me to draw a bow of bronze. ,2 Samuel 22:35,"What a picture of the conquering power of God we see as David rehearsed the exploits of his mighty men (2 Samuel 23)! One of them killed eight hundred men (v. 8), and others killed hundreds singlehandedly. Three of them broke through an entire army to bring David a drink of water (v. 16). One killed a lion in a pit and snatched a spear from a giant (vv. 20-21).

Oh, the mighty exploits of those who are filled with the holy power of God! After he was baptized in the Holy Spirit, Peter’s boldness in the face of hostile Jerusalem was just as awesome as the courage of David’s mighty men.

Away with weak, cowardly Christianity! Let us yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit and prepare for triumphant battle with the enemy. We are the mighty men and women of the Holy Spirit under the New Covenant.

Our power is not intended for destruction, but for reconciliation. Our victory will not be a military victory, but a harvest of souls. “Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church—about three thousand in all” (Acts 2:41).

Under the Holy Spirit’s influence, someone will lead thousands to the Lord. Why shouldn’t it be you?"
06-05,06-05,156,"We look to the Lord our God for his mercy, just as servants keep their eyes on their master, as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal. ",Psalm 123:2,"David was in a mess. He had done a foolish thing when he tempted the Lord by counting his fighting men. God gave him three choices of judgment, and they all sounded bad! David wisely chose the option that involved God’s mercy, for he said, “But let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercy is great. Do not let me fall into human hands” (2 Samuel 24:14).

The man at the gate Beautiful looked at thousands of people every day as he begged for financial mercies. Peter addressed the man, saying, “Look at us!” (Acts 3:4). Peter wanted the lame man to look to the Lord for His mercy. The power of the name of Jesus healed the man, who joyfully jumped up, “walking, leaping, and praising God”

(v. 8).

We may look to many men and various sources to help us through our problems, but eventually we must go to “the source of every mercy and the God who comforts us” (2 Corinthians 1:3). Are you in trouble? Don’t take your eyes off God your Father, for “his mercy endureth for ever” (Psalm 118:1 KJV)."
06-06,06-06,157,"We escaped like a bird from a hunter’s trap. The trap is broken, and we are free! Our help is from the Lord, who made the heavens and the earth. ",Psalm 124:7-8,"David knew what he was talking about, for he had faced one close call after another during his lifetime. Near the end of his life, he faced the ultimate snare: an insurrection in which one of his own rebellious sons attempted to usurp the throne from David’s chosen heir. But God always provides a way of escape! The plot drew the attention of Nathan, and in a swift series of events, the plan of the rebels was foiled and Solomon was installed as king.

The apostles also escaped from a snare set against them. The Sanhedrin rulers were furious with the apostles for healing the cripple. They purposed to beat them, jail them, or threaten them in some way. Instead, the Lord delivered them, restored them to their friends, and filled them with the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:23-31).

Satan’s traps and snares are well hidden and powerful, but just when it seems his plot has succeeded, God provides a way of escape. Never fear—He’ll do it for you!"
06-07,06-07,158,"There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death. ",Proverbs 16:25,"How well the characters in today’s readings bear out this scripture! Adonijah requested his father’s concubine, a move that would have brought him much political power. Solomon answered that request by having Adonijah and his cohort Joab put to death (1 Kings 2:13-34).

Shimei disobeyed the clear instructions of Solomon to remain in the physical vicinity of Jerusalem. Shimei thought his disobedience in taking a little side trip to Gath would go unnoticed, but Solomon also had him put to death (1 Kings 2:36-46).

Ananias and Sapphira thought that a little deception concerning the sale price of their land would go unnoticed. However, they discovered that God does not judge us by what we think is right, but by what He declares to be right. God’s judgment struck swiftly and left them both dead (Acts 5:1-10).

The devil is constantly filling our minds with little compromises that we must discern as evil. Our thoughts must line up with the measuring rod of God’s Word. If they don’t, we must run from them, because they will lead to certain death!"
06-08,06-08,159,None of them was able to stand against the wisdom and Spirit by which Stephen spoke. ,Acts 6:10,"Wisdom is the most powerful force in the world—a force greater than riches, power, or long life. Solomon realized that without wisdom his youthfulness and lack of experience would quickly disqualify him from leading a nation of millions of people. He therefore asked God, “Give me an understanding mind so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great nation of yours?” (1 Kings 3:9).

God was pleased with Solomon’s request and granted him not only wisdom but also riches, honor, and long life. Because of his great wisdom, the kings and queens of the entire earth came before Solomon’s throne. His God-given wisdom enabled him to efficiently administrate the kingdom by using twelve district governors. Furthermore, he knew the solution to difficult problems of justice in civil disputes (v. 28).

Solomon’s wisdom extended into the natural world, too. “He composed some 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs. He could speak with authority about all kinds of plants, from the great cedar of Lebanon to the tiny hyssop that grows from cracks in a wall. He could also speak about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish” (1 Kings 4:32-33).

Peter and the apostles realized that if people were “well respected” and “full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom” (Acts 6:3), they could be placed in positions of responsibility. Today, in faith, ask God for wisdom to enter your heart. Then watch as He promotes you to new responsibility and privilege in the eyes of both God and humanity!"
06-09,06-09,160,"Unless the Lord builds a house, the work of the builders is useless. ",Psalm 127:1,"Solomon had a vision to build the most magnificent temple in history, and his success resulted from the blessing of the Lord. First, the Lord gave Solomon wisdom to achieve his purpose (1 Kings 5:12). He showed him how to rotate his labor force in such a way that the men could be in Lebanon one month and at home for two months. Shared responsibility, as indicated by rotating the labor force, was a wise plan from God to cover responsibilities without burning out the laborers.

Second, Solomon achieved success because he followed the plan of the Lord (1 Kings 6:12). You cannot hope to succeed at any work for God if you deviate from the revelation in the Bible. All work must follow the exact plan of the Church as given in the Gospels, Acts, and the Epistles.

Finally, Solomon succeeded because he persevered. He spent seven years building the temple (1 Kings 6:38), never wavering from his goal. Never give up when God is “building” with you. Though it may seem your work is moving at a crawl, keep doing what you know to do.

Purpose, plan, and persevere, and the Lord will build your house!"
06-10,06-10,161,"So King Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the Lord. Then Solomon brought all the gifts his father, David, had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the other utensils—and he stored them in the treasuries of the Lord’s Temple. ",1 Kings 7:51,"Solomon’s temple was indeed magnificent when one considers the brass, the silver, and the gold contained within it. For seven years men crafted the temple, with no budget considerations and an unlimited source of building materials. This house was the most magnificent edifice ever created by any human being, before or since.

For all the beauty and greatness of Solomon’s house, however, “the Most High doesn’t live in temples made by human hands” (Acts 7:48). To think that God would be tied down to any building, temple, denomination, or culture is ridiculous! We are not building an earthly temple for God, but a spiritual temple. God has chosen to live in human hearts, and the temple we are constructing is made of living stones (1 Peter 2:5)— believers from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation.

Someone once told a story of three men who were working side-by-side laying brick. When asked, “What are you doing?” one answered, “Laying brick.” Another answered, “Raising a wall.” The last answered, “Building a great cathedral.”

Lord, give us spiritual vision to see that we are building the greatest temple in the universe: the Church of Jesus Christ!"
06-11,06-11,162,Philip . . . went to the city of Samaria and told the people there about the Messiah. Crowds listened intently to what he had to say because of the miracles he did. Many evil spirits were cast out. . . . And many who hadbeen paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was great joy in that city. ,Acts 8:5-8,"Philip preached the Word, and God performed miracles. The manifested presence of God brought joy, and the miracles attested to the fact that God was in Samaria.

In 1 Kings 8:11, God’s presence so permeated the atmosphere in the magnificent temple that “the priests could not continue their work because the glorious presence of the Lord filled the Temple.” After the celebration of the Festival of Shelters that followed the dedication of Solomon’s temple, the people of Jerusalem were “joyful and happy because the Lord had been good to his servant David and to his people Israel” (1 Kings 8:66).

When we, as believers, become dry and lethargic in our worship and evangelism, our real need is for more of the manifested presence of God. His presence refreshes, rejoices, renews, and makes us desire to tell everyone of His goodness. As Solomon did, let us fall to our knees and pray for His presence to fill our temples. Then all men will see and believe that “there is no God like [ours] in all heaven or earth” (1 Kings 8:23)."
06-12,06-12,163,"When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s reputation, which brought honor to the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions. ",1 Kings 10:1,"Money does not satisfy. Had it satisfied the queen of Sheba, she never would have traveled for hundreds of miles over ancient roads and deserts just to hear the words of God from Solomon. The human heart craves more than money. It craves answers to life’s purpose and longs to see the wisdom and power of God.

Simon was willing to pay money to obtain the power of laying hands on people to receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:18-19). The treasurer for Candace, the queen of Ethiopia, was more interested in knowing whom Isaiah was describing than he was in acquiring all the wealth of which he was steward (v. 34). Even Solomon with his hundreds of talents of gold per year was not satisfied with worldly wealth, and his wandering, searching heart thus delved into idolatry.

Don’t let the devil dangle riches before your eyes, telling you that money will fulfill you. Those who have handled vast sums of it will tell you otherwise. Use money as a tool to evangelize the world, and enjoy the free riches of the Kingdom of God!"
06-13,06-13,164,"But the Lord said, “Go and do what I say. For Saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel.” ",Acts 9:15,"How can we explain God’s choices? In John 15:16, Jesus said, “You didn’t choose me. I chose you.” Saul was the last person we would have expected God to select as an instrument to tell the world about Jesus. But we know from 1 Corinthians 1:27 that God deliberately chooses “things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise.” In choosing Saul as a divine instrument, God certainly knew that his testimony would totally confound the Jews.

Jeroboam, another of God’s unlikely choices, was equally surprised when the prophet Ahijah informed him of his future destiny as the king of Israel (1 Kings 11:29). In a moment, because of God’s sovereign selection, the entire course of his life was altered.

You may never figure out the ways of God in laying His hand on seemingly unworthy vessels in order to glorify Himself. Yet if you are a Christian, you are chosen. If you are chosen, you are ordained. If you are ordained, you will produce fruit (John 15:16).

Relax, and carry out your calling!"
06-14,06-14,165,"Then at the Lord’s command, he shouted, “O altar, altar! This is what the Lord says: A child named Josiah will be born into the dynasty of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests from the pagan shrines who come here to burn incense, and human bones will be burned on you.” ",1 Kings 13:2,"This remarkable prophecy reminds us of the foreknowledge of God, for King Josiah of Judah was not born until nearly three hundred years after the word of the Lord had foretold it! Imagine if someone on the Mayflower had announced the exact name of a recently elected American president and had described in detail his policies and actions. Such a scenario would be similar to what happened with Josiah, for he fulfilled the prophecy concerning his life down to the smallest detail (2 Kings 23:15-16).

Our lives are not accidental, but are carefully purposed by God to bring glory to His name. We are indeed children of destiny. The Lord told Jeremiah, “I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my spokesman to the world” (Jeremiah 1:5). Rest today in the foreknowledge of God concerning your destiny. From the beginning of time, God has had His eye upon you!"
06-15,06-15,166,"Meanwhile, as Peter was puzzling over the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him, “Three men have come looking for you. Go down and go with them without hesitation. All is well, for I have sent them.” ",Acts 10:19-20,"The spiritual gift of the word of knowledge enabled both Peter and Ahijah (1 Kings 14:5) to know the purpose of their household visitors. Without a direct revelation from the Holy Spirit, neither of these men would have had any idea who their guests were or why they were visiting.

The Holy Spirit knows all things and occasionally releases into our minds critical information that does not come from our own investigative powers. How miraculous it was for the blind prophet Ahijah not to be fooled by a masquerading queen! Instead, he called the queen by name and told her the reason she had come. He even gave an accurate prediction of her son’s imminent death, which came to pass exactly as he had said (1 Kings 14:12, 17).

Let us reverence the Holy Spirit’s gifts, for they are incredible tools that enable us to know both the circumstances and the motives of human hearts. Also, because He knows us as well as He knew Ahijah’s and Peter’s visitors, it would be well for us to keep our own lives pure!"
06-16,06-16,167,"Then the Lord said to Elijah, “Go and live in the village of Zarephath, near the city of Sidon. There is a widow there who will feed you. I have given her my instructions.” ",1 Kings 17:8-9,"Someone has called Elijah’s journey the place called there. During the three and one-half years of drought, God always directed him to go there. God commanded a widow to feed him there (1 Kings 17:9). There is an exact place where God wants us to be so He can sustain and bless us.

Peter found the place called there when he was obedient and went to the house of Cornelius. Peter, like Elijah, was instructed to go to the home of a Gentile. This was the opposite of what they had been taught in their Jewish upbringing.

The place called there may not be the place we would naturally choose. However, it is the place where there is the greatest hunger. A desperately hungry widow and a spiritually hungry centurion both received the blessing from a man of God directed to their homes. As someone once said, “Where God guides, He provides.” We must endeavor to always remain in the place called there."
06-17,06-17,168,"The Lord does whatever pleases him throughout all heaven and earth, and on the seas and in their depths. ",Psalm 135:7,"The truth of this scripture was demonstrated in Elijah’s powerful confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). First, God sent the drought to draw the people into the arena of decision. Then, He sent the fire to convince them of their sin. Finally, He sent the rain to remind them of His blessing.

God is able to do “whatever pleases Him,” at whatever time it pleases Him. When God was ready to visit the Gentiles, He did whatever pleased Him! But Peter had to spend time trying to convince the Jerusalem eldership that God was the Author of the Cornelius visitation (Acts 11:4).

He is a mighty God, and His power can flow in whatever direction His love desires. Get out of the way and let God move! The result will be as it was in Acts 11:21 NIV: “The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people turned and believed in the Lord.”"
06-18,06-18,169,He remembered our utter weakness. His faithful love endures forever. ,Psalm 136:23,"The One who remembers us in our times of trouble also remembered Elijah and Peter at their lowest points. Elijah was suffering from burnout after fighting the victorious battle on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 19:4), but an angel of the Lord came and strengthened him. God gave him new vision and direction for his life. Peter, also in dire straits, had an angelic visitation and was rescued from prison the night before he was to be executed.

You can learn from these examples that God remembers you in your human frailty when you are worn-out in mind, body, and spirit from the fatigue of spiritual warfare. When you are at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on. Help is on the way!

God receives the greatest glory when His servants come to the end of their resources and can only look up. Ask Him to strengthen you today in your weakness, for His love truly endures forever."
06-19,06-19,170,"Then the man of God went to the king of Israel and said, “This is what the Lord says: The Arameans have said that the Lord is a god of the hills and not of the plains. So I will help you defeat this vast army. Then you will know that I am the Lord.” ",1 Kings 20:28,"Oh, the power of prophetic confrontation! Since earliest times, kings and leaders of nations have been challenged by the miracles and rebukes of anointed prophets. Ahab was shown a miraculous sign when God delivered the Arameans into his hands. Then Elijah confronted Ahab in Naboth’s vineyard as God judged him for Naboth’s murder (1 Kings 21:17). The proconsul Sergius Paulus witnessed a powerful miracle when God struck the sorcerer blind (Acts 13:11). These confrontational miracles were intended to demonstrate to those in authority that God is Lord of heaven and earth.

In Christ you have the authority to confront those in leadership with the claims of Christ. No power is greater than God, and He has given you power so you might bring the Gospel to world leaders. The same Spirit that filled Paul and blinded Elymas (Acts 13:9) is in you. Don’t be afraid, but speak boldly. God will surely back you up!"
06-20,06-20,171,"But Micaiah replied, “As surely as the Lord lives, I will say only what the Lord tells me to say.” ",1 Kings 22:14,"Compromise is the price a person is willing to pay to a false god. That was Jehoshaphat’s problem. In an effort to promote peace and unity, he was willing to ally himself with Ahab, a man who was vile and wicked before God (1 Kings 22:4).

People often compromise because of a desire to be socially accepted. They overlook glaring abuses of God’s Word in order to maintain relationships. Micaiah, however, refused to compromise or make even one small concession to Ahab’s false religious system. He was willing to endure physical attack and imprisonment just to maintain the witness of truth against Ahab (1 Kings 22:17, 22-24). Although confined in prison, Micaiah was safer than was Jehoshaphat, who almost lost his life in the brief battle that ensued.

Look at the end result of compromise, and settle in your mind that you owe no allegiance to the idols of this world. They and their worshipers will one day perish with the same fate as Ahab’s!"
06-21,06-21,172,"O Lord, you have examined my heart and know everything about me. You know when I sit down or stand up. You know my every thought when far away. You chart the path ahead of me and tell me where to stop and rest. Every moment you know where I am. ",Psalm 139:1-3,"What comfort and fear it should bring to know that God is intimately acquainted with both our every move and also our every mistake! He sent Elijah to intercept the messengers of Ahaziah and to inform them of God’s verdict on his injury (2 Kings 1:4). Nothing was hidden from God’s eyes, even things intended to be kept secret. Through a revelation given by the Holy Spirit, the prophets of Jericho and Bethel discerned that Elijah would be taken to heaven on the very day that he eventually was (2 Kings 2:3, 5).

God knows your every step and misstep, and He even records your actions in His book before one of them comes to be (Psalm 139:16). Wherever you go, whatever you do today, God’s Spirit will be there, observing, helping, and protecting. Relax in His great omniscience, and walk carefully. The greatest miracle of all is that He knows you intimately and still loves you unconditionally!"
06-22,06-22,173,"“What can I do to help you?” Elisha asked. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?” ",2 Kings 4:2,"God’s miracles always start with the question, What do you have? The little boy with five loaves and two fish provided the only resource for Jesus to bless and feed the five thousand. The widow who fed Elijah during the famine possessed only a little meal and a little oil as a resource. The common thread in both these miracles is that faith was mixed with a few small things offered to God.

If you have a need, you must first put something into God’s hand for Him to work with and multiply back to you. We call this seed sowing, or placing into the soil of faith some object that we “lose” in order that God may multiply it into a harvest.

Don’t wait for God to supply your need—use what you have! God asked Moses, “What do you have there in your hand?” (Exodus 4:2), and the rod became the means of Israel’s deliverance from Egypt. Give your resources to God, and watch Him multiply them for your deliverance!"
06-23,06-23,174,"One day the girl said to her mistress, “I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria. He would heal him of his leprosy.” ",2 Kings 5:3,"Naaman’s young servant girl had no idea how important her little remark to his wife would be in bringing about her master’s deliverance from leprosy. God often uses the faith of others to start the cycle of healing and deliverance when a person is unable to start it for himself.

The four men who brought the paralytic to Christ and let him down through the roof were the direct agents of their friend’s healing (Mark 2:3). Perhaps you can “hold the rope” for some sick friend who has no knowledge of (or hope for) healing. Though this person may not realize the importance of believing God’s healing promises, you must remain convinced that God is the answer.

The little servant girl risked her life to confirm assuredly to Naaman’s wife that if her husband went to the prophet in Samaria, he would cure him of leprosy. This bold statement of faith started the cycle of Naaman’s deliverance and ended with his flesh becoming as clean as the flesh of a young boy.

In whose life could your faith make a difference today?"
06-24,06-24,175,"But as one of them was chopping, his ax head fell into the river. “Ah, my lord!” he cried. “It was a borrowed ax!” ",2 Kings 6:5,"The story of the lost ax head is so descriptive of the human condition. First, the ax head was not with its rightful master. In the same way, we once belonged to God, but Satan stole us in the Garden of Eden and made us his slaves.

Second, the ax head was in the wrong place. It should have been out doing its work, but instead it was on the bottom of the Jordan in an alien environment. When we were in sin, we were completely submerged in the wrong environment—dead to God and alienated from His life.

Finally, the ax head could not save itself. The ax head had no power to change its situation; thus, it was destined to remain stuck in the mud. Only when “Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water” (2 Kings 6:6) did the ax head supernaturally begin to rise from the bottom in a physical “resurrection.” What a picture of Jesus’ death and resurrection!

No amount of personal desire or willpower can lift us from the muddy quagmire of sin if we are stuck fast in it. Only Jesus can deliver us. We then belong to God, never to return to the bottom again!"
06-25,06-25,176,"They replied, “Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with your entire household.” ",Acts 16:31,"Household salvation is a promise stated throughout the Word of God. Paul told the Philippian jailer that if he gave his heart to Jesus, he and his family would be saved. That night both he and his entire family became Christians (Acts 16:34). At that moment, all their names were recorded in the Lamb’s Book of Life.

As the children of Israel waited for judgment to fall upon their nation, they were instructed to offer a lamb for a household (Exodus 12:3). We should never stop pressing this claim of the Word of God for our families to be saved from the wrath to come.

We must daily bring our families and relatives before the Father. Noah entered the ark with his entire family. Job prayed continually for his children, in case one of them had done something to offend God. It pleases the Lord when we remind Him of our kindred relationship to our families and stand against Satan’s attempts to totally defeat them.

Place the blood of Jesus daily over the doorpost of your household. Claim today that all your household will join you in heaven and will bring you joy here on earth as well!"
06-26,06-26,177,"Bless the Lord, who is my rock. He gives me strength for war and skill for battle. ",Psalm 144:1,"We are locked into a spiritual battle over areas of our lives that the enemy seeks to control, including our families, our finances, and our safety. But God gives us the strength and ability to skillfully confront and win every battle that rages against us.

David understood the principles of both spiritual and natural warfare; consequently, he fought his battles with not only the sword but also praise and worship. The results of his victory in spiritual warfare are evident in Psalm 144: blessings to his sons and daughters

God wants to bless you, but until you learn spiritual warfare, you will live under the enemy’s curse. You may be begging and pleading with God for blessing, while all the time the thief is actually stealing your inheritance and blessings!

Begin today to praise and worship the Lord for the victory won for you at the cross and through the resurrection. Focus on your position in the heavenlies (Ephesians 2:6), and demand that the devil loose your family, finances, and security. Your blessings must release. You may have to fight for a while, but the victory is assured if you persevere!"
06-27,06-27,178,"The Lord protects all those who love him, but he destroys the wicked. ",Psalm 145:20,"How beautifully this principle is illustrated in the lives of Joash and Paul! Little Joash, at only seven years of age, was defenseless against the ruthless Queen Athaliah. “Joash and his nurse remained hidden in the Temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land” (2 Kings 11:3). Only the Lord could have kept him from crying at the wrong moment or being seen by someone who was friendly to the queen. Athaliah finally met her death, the Lord fulfilling His promise to destroy the wicked.

Paul faced great danger from the Jews at Corinth. “One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision and told him, ‘Don’t be afraid! Speak out! Don’t be silent! For I am with you, and no one will harm you because many people here in this city belong to me’ ” (Acts 18:9-10). The Jews’ efforts to bring legal action against Paul ended in their being thrown out of court in one moment of time.

Satan makes you think the end is here, the worst has come, and the game is lost. Remember: It’s not over until it’s over. The Lord is watching over you!"
06-28,06-28,179,"Once when some Israelites were burying a man, they spied a band of [Moabite] raiders. So they hastily threw the body they were burying into the tomb of Elisha. But as soon as the body touched Elisha’s bones, the dead man revived and jumped to his feet! ",2 Kings 13:21,"The power of God is tangible! Elisha had been buried for an undetermined period of time when another dead man was accidentally thrown into his grave. Elisha’s bones had so much of the power of God still residing in them that they caused the dead man to resurrect. And to think, we have trouble raising the dead while we are still alive!

Paul’s body also contained great power from God. Even handkerchiefs that he had touched could be taken to the sick to bring healing (Acts 19:11-12). Obviously, Jesus carried this power, too. People could touch the hem of His garment and be completely healed.

In each of these cases, the power of God inhabited the physical world and was able to be transmitted. Why should we think it strange that God’s supernatural, miracle-working power can break into the physical world and change even the most desperate of circumstances?

If we are filled with the Holy Spirit, this same power is in us. We must exercise it to minister justice to the oppressed, provide food for the hungry, and bring freedom to the captives (Psalm 146:7)."
06-29,06-29,180,He sends peace across your nation and satisfies you with plenty of the finest wheat. ,Psalm 147:14,"Satan’s ugly, violent acts of horror are graphically painted throughout the Old Testament. We find monarchs murdered, pregnant women mutilated, and children sacrificed in fire (2 Kings 15:16, 16:3). We see idolatry in its basest form with the establishment of demonic altars in the temple of God (2 Kings 16:10-14).

In the New Testament, we find Jewish exorcists helpless before the violent power of demon spirits. One man possessed by an evil spirit overcame the seven sons of Sceva, taunting, “I know Jesus, and I know Paul. But who are you?” (Acts 19:15). We see that many people in Ephesus lived under demonic oppression and practiced magic before coming to Christ (v. 19). In fact, so steeped in idolatry was Ephesus that the entire city ranted and raved against Paul and rose up to defend the honor of the false goddess Artemis (v. 27).

We cannot deny that Satan has spread his unclean message across all cultures and throughout all history. The good news is that we are not of his kingdom! We are those to whom the Lord grants peace and satisfaction.

Claim the peace of God for your life, and allow no trace of Satan’s kingdom to penetrate!"
06-30,06-30,181,"Yet I never shrank from telling you the truth, either publicly or in your homes. ",Acts 20:20,"From this verse in Acts, we get “20/20 vision”! Paul reminded the Ephesian elders that his message had been consistent everywhere he had gone, both in public forums and to individuals in their own homes. He did not confine his ministry only to open, public services, but he also went into homes. This was the pattern of ministry for the early Church.

The second part of 20/20 vision was Paul’s declaration for men to turn to God in repentance and have faith in Christ Jesus (Acts 20:21). The message was twofold: repent and believe. This was the pattern of preaching for the early Church. When we stray from the simplicity of this message, we will not be effective in reaching a godless, confused society.

The final part of Paul’s 20/20 vision was the pattern for commitment. Knowing he was facing trouble and death in Jerusalem, he still said, “My life is worth nothing unless I use it for doing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus—the work of telling others the Good News about God’s wonderful kindness and love” (Acts 20:24). This was the pattern of sacrifice for the early Church. Christians were willing to die to reach the world with the message of salvation.

Have you checked your 20/20 vision lately?"
07-01,07-01,182,"Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song. Sing his praises in the assembly of the faithful. O Israel, rejoice in your Maker. O people of Jerusalem, exult in your King. Praise his name with dancing, accompanied by tambourine and harp. ",Psalm 149:1-3,"What is it about praise that is so powerful? Why are we so strongly exhorted in so many scriptures to praise the Lord?

First, praise blesses God. When His people praise His name with dancing and make music to Him with tambourine and harp, the Lord takes delight in them (Psalm 149:4). We bless Him when we dance, clap, rejoice, and are glad in Him. The saints should ever “rejoice in his honor” and “sing for joy as they lie on their beds” (v. 5).

Second, praise engages mighty warfare against the enemy. If it is our honor to praise the Lord, then it is our glory to put our enemies to flight through praise (v. 9). Praise has the power “to bind their kings with shackles and their leaders with iron chains” (v. 8). As we praise God, the sentence upon our enemies as written in the Word of God is executed.

Never underestimate the power of praise. King Hezekiah’s simple worship and prayer brought the angel of the Lord into his situation. In one night, the angel killed 185,000 Assyrian troops, and Judah was delivered from the enemy’s hands (2 Kings 19:35).

Praise ye the Lord!"
07-02,07-02,183,The name of the Lord is a strong fortress; the godly run to him and are safe. ,Proverbs 18:10,"In the midst of the terrible ordeals of life, we often don’t know to whom we can turn. In 2 Kings 20, Hezekiah was facing death because a terrible sickness had attacked his body. To whom did he turn in his hour of need? The Word of God tells us that “he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord” (v. 2).

The “wall” represents the tower of the Lord. In his moment of desperate need, Hezekiah’s eyes were no longer fixed on human methods and reports. The things of the world no longer distracted his vision. Rather, he raced to safety inside the tower of the Lord.

The Lord heard his cry and instructed Isaiah to have Hezekiah’s servants apply an ointment made from figs. They obeyed his command, and Hezekiah was healed. Because he had run to God, God heard his prayer, saw his tears, and added fifteen years to his life (vv. 5-6).

The tower of the Lord is a supernatural tower. It is so strong that it can turn the sun backward ten degrees, a feat that boggles the mind when the laws of physics are considered. Leave your present fears behind and run into the tower of the Lord. It is the one place you are safe!"
07-03,07-03,184,"Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the court secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord’s Temple!” Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan, and he read it. ",2 Kings 22:8,"The Word of God is the one factor in your life that will determine your level of blessing. David wrote that the person whose delight is in the law of the Lord would find that whatever he does prospers (Psalm 1:2-3).

Josiah’s life turned completely around the moment the high priest said he had located the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord. Reading the Word sparked a righteous indignation in Josiah’s spirit, and he cleansed both Judah and Israel of their false gods with a determination unsurpassed in biblical history.

Your heart may be predisposed to serving God, but hearing the Word in your heart will light the fire of conviction. If you devote your life to reading and meditating on the Word, you will remain continually opposed to sin. You will also be disposed to God and to fulfilling the destiny He has for you.

In this second half of the year, devote yourself fully to the Word of God. Read and devour it as would a hungry person, and put whatever you read into practice. When you do, the Lord promises that you will be blessed!"
07-04,07-04,185,"In the thirty-seventh year of King Jehoiachin’s exile in Babylon, Evil-merodach ascended to the Babylonian throne. He was kind to Jehoiachin and released him from prison. . . . ",2 Kings 25:27,"Jehoiachin’s life is a tremendous picture of God’s judgment and grace. His sin landed him in a dungeon for thirty-seven years; then suddenly without explanation the king sent for him and released him from prison. More favor was extended to him through kind words, a position of honor, daily food at the king’s table, and a regular allowance for the rest of his life.

In the same way, God reached down into the dark prison house of sin, and by grace He instantly released us from our sentence. He cleaned us up, spoke His love to us, and seated us “with him in the heavenly realms” (Ephesians 2:6). He dressed us in the finest robes of righteousness and continues to feed us each day with living bread from the table of the Word of God. Finally, He provides for all our material needs on a daily basis by promising to supply all our needs according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19).

“Now then, you kings, act wisely! Be warned, you rulers of the earth!” (Psalm 2:10). Let us not boast of our positions, prestige, or prosperity. We are where we are because of God’s incredible grace!"
07-05,07-05,186,"O Lord, I have so many enemies; so many are against me. So many are saying, “God will never rescue him!” But you, O Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts my head high. ",Psalm 3:1-3,"Paul could identify with the psalmist, for he was surrounded by hundreds of hostile Jews who were bent on his destruction. Their plot to assassinate him seemed foolproof, except for the fact that Paul knew the Lord was the lifter of his head. In fact, God had already arranged for Paul’s nephew to hear of the plan and to be taken to inform the commander of the army of the evil plot. The commander then intervened, and the plot was foiled (Acts 23:16, 23-24).

There is a place of rest in the Lord where we do not fear the plots of the enemy. Instead, we lie down and sleep because the Lord sustains us (Psalm 3:5). We are encircled by God’s protection, and Satan cannot enter that circle without God’s permission. We can rest easy today under God’s shield, for He will not allow the plots, devices, and arrows of the devil to remain inside our circle forever.

Let us make David’s prayer our own: “Arise, O Lord! Rescue me, my God! Slap all my enemies in the face! Shatter the teeth of the wicked”

(v. 7). Whatever plot the enemy may have hatched, God has a mes-senger—perhaps a nephew—to foil it!"
07-06,07-06,187,"I have hope in God, just as these men do, that he will raise both the righteous and the ungodly. Because of this, I always try to maintain a clear conscience before God and everyone else. ",Acts 24:15-16,"In Acts 24 Paul could not be swayed to offer a bribe to Governor Felix (v. 26). He kept his conscience clear before both God and man. Consequently, he was able to reason with Felix concerning “righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come” (v. 25).

Our primary witness to the lost comes from who we are, not just what we say. Felix believed that any man could be bought for a price and that Paul’s words would eventually yield to his lusts. He found in Paul, however, a man genuinely concerned about the governor’s soul—a man who was totally unmoved by materialism. Paul had discovered that “the Lord has set apart the godly for himself” (Psalm 4:3). Because of Paul’s integrity, nothing could penetrate his shield of protection.

Be careful of your witness, as well as your words, in front of those you seek to influence. Satan will try to negate your witness by your works. One false move and all that you say will be meaningless. If you are going to preach about the judgment to come, live as though you are ready for the judgment. Then your witness will be powerful."
07-07,07-07,188,"He was the one who prayed to the God of Israel, “Oh that you would bless me and extend my lands! Please be with me in all that I do, and keep me from all trouble and pain!” And God granted him his request. ",1 Chronicles 4:10,"The prayer of Jabez is a cry for deliverance from a life of pain. The name Jabez means “distress,” or “pain,” and accordingly, from the day of his birth, Jabez endured much pain.

Satan seeks to afflict those who are honorable with pain and sorrow in order to destroy their effectiveness. Jabez prayed for God to turn the devil’s curse into blessing and his own limitations into enlargement. Our prayers, too, should be for God to enlarge our territory just as He did for Jabez, who had been through such pain and sorrow. We want to be enlarged, not for personal pride and pleasure, but to reach into the regions beyond with the Gospel.

Jabez also prayed that God would keep him from harm so he could be delivered from a life of pain, sorrow, and distraction. And God granted his request!

Why not pray today for God to reverse the curse and break the limitations you have faced, perhaps even from birth? He will spread His protection over you (Psalm 5:11) and surround you with favor as with a shield (v. 12)!"
07-08,07-08,189,"They cried out to God during the battle, and he answered their prayer because they trusted in him. ",1 Chronicles 5:20,"God helped the Reubenites, Gadites, and men of Manasseh when they waged war because they pleaded for His help in the midst of the battle. He answered their prayers “because they trusted in him.”

In spiritual warfare you must remember two things. First, you need to pray constantly while the battle is raging. Assemble a group who will commit to pray continually until the battle turns and the victory is won. Second, remember that the Lord is fighting against the enemy (1 Chronicles 5:22). Recognize that it is really not your battle, but the Lord’s.

God and Satan are irreconcilable enemies, and God is as interested in your victory as you are. When you realize that God is actually fighting your battle, you will say to the enemy as David did to Goliath, “The Lord does not need weapons to rescue his people. It is his battle, not ours. The Lord will give you to us!” (1 Samuel 17:47).

Many times you lose spiritual battles when you start complaining, whining, and muttering about your defeat. “Those who love to talk will experience the consequences, for the tongue can kill or nourish life” (Proverbs 18:21). Guard your tongue, and every day proclaim, “The battle is the Lord’s.” He will not let you be defeated!"
07-09,07-09,190,"“Sirs,” he said, “I believe there is trouble ahead if we go on—shipwreck, loss of cargo, injuries, and danger to our lives. ",Acts 27:10,"How easily we can be blown off course from the will of God by listening to advice from others instead of listening to a word from the Lord! Paul tried to convince the centurion that he had heard from God concerning great danger to the ship if they set sail from Fair Havens. Nevertheless, the centurion followed the advice of the pilot and the owner of the ship (Acts 27:11).

Someone once said, “We don’t need good advice. We need a word from the Lord!” God does not need decision makers—He needs hearers. In every circumstance, He has a planned way of escape (1 Corinthians 10:13), if we will take the time to listen to Him. The pilot and ship’s owner thought they had made the right decision “when a light wind began blowing from the south” (Acts 27:13). How quickly, however, did the dreamy breeze turn into a nightmare storm!

Do not try to discern the right direction with your natural mind, but wait upon the Lord and listen to His counsel. In the end, you will save yourself much heartache, for “the Lord’s purpose will prevail” (Proverbs 19:21). If you follow His counsel, you will discover that God is your shield, “saving those whose hearts are true and right” (Psalm 7:10)."
07-10,07-10,191,So take courage! For I believe God. It will be just as he said. ,Acts 27:25,"Purpose can make a huge difference in a person’s life. The crew of Paul’s ship had given up all hope of being saved (Acts 27:20) after being relentlessly tossed in a mighty storm for two weeks. Still Paul was not moved. He knew he had a purpose to fulfill, for an angel had spoken to him, telling him that he would “surely stand trial before Caesar” (v. 24). Believing that nothing could defeat what God had determined, Paul encouraged everyone around him that all would be well.

When the circumstances of life fail to line up with your expectations, you can feel trapped, and the world becomes a hopeless place. God, however, has a plan for you, and when you find His purpose for your life, adverse circumstances become meaningless. No matter the difficulty, Satan cannot destroy you before you fulfill your purpose.

In Acts 27:28, when all hope seemed gone, suddenly a slight change appeared: the depth of the water lessened. As you cling to your purpose and God’s promise, suddenly the battle will begin to turn. It may seem almost imperceptible at first, but nothing will stop God from fulfilling His purposes.

That’s exactly what David experienced. After all the years of his trials with Saul, the day finally came when God removed Saul from the scene and “turned his kingdom over to David son of Jesse” (1 Chronicles 10:14).

Keep sailing. God is not finished with you yet!"
07-11,07-11,192,"All of them were expert archers, and they could shoot arrows or sling stones with their left hand as well as their right. ",1 Chronicles 12:2,"David’s army was awesome. Some of his men were ambidextrous, so skilled and versatile that they could shoot arrows or sling stones with either hand. One was so powerful that he snatched a spear from an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall and killed him with his own spear (1 Chronicles 11:23). Others “were expert with both shield and spear, as fierce as lions and as swift as deer on the mountains” (12:8).

The common thread running throughout David’s army was courage. Not one was fearful, hesitant, or puny. All were talented, resolute, and aggressive. They worked with precision, totally destroying the enemies of God with an awesome unity of spirit.

Paul, too, showed courage. He was so brave that he simply “shook off the snake into the fire and was unharmed” (Acts 28:5). The islanders kept waiting for him to collapse, but he just kept right on going.

The day of weak and cowardly soldiers is over! The world is watching your courage in adversity. Quit taking your spiritual temperature all the time, and step into your mighty position in God. You are in His awesome army!"
07-12,07-12,193,"So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand.” So that place was called Baal Perazim. ",1 Chronicles 14:11 NIV,"God wants you to “break through” in every difficult situation you face! David faced his first and greatest challenge from the Philistines immediately after he was anointed king. David asked God if he should go out and fight the Philistines, and God instructed him to attack, assuring David that He would give him the victory. Desiring to honor God for answering his prayers, David renamed the area of battle so that everyone who came there in the future would know of God’s goodness to him in that place. It was known as the place of breakthrough.

David referred to the battle in terms of the innate power that water has to break through any resistance. A flood of waters is an awesome force. It can break down dams, dikes, and walls, even moving rocks as it overwhelms everything in its path. Even more mighty is God’s power, a force so great that it sweeps away any barrier the enemy tries to erect against us.

Not only is God powerful in giving the breakthrough, but He is also strategic. In the second battle against the Philistines (1 Chronicles 14:14), God told David to encircle them and launch a surprise attack. David obeyed and broke through to victory again. Here we see that God is infinitely more powerful than the devil—and smarter!

Wait upon God for His strategy, and move at His command. Believe today that His power and His wisdom will give you a breakthrough, for He is Lord of the Breakthrough!"
07-13,07-13,194,"But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who push the truth away from themselves. For the truth about God is known to them instinctively. God has put this knowledge in their hearts. ",Romans 1:18-19,"Humanism tells us, “I’m okay . . . you’re okay” and says that salvation is little more than a contribution to one’s own personal happiness. As Christians, however, we know that without the salvation purchased by Jesus’ blood, humanity is hopeless.

Nowhere is the wickedness of humanity described in more graphic detail than in Romans 1 and Psalm 10. Paul begins Romans with a thorough description of the wickedness of humankind, coupled with a justification for the wrath of God. He continues with a description of how people have rejected the truth of God because of pride (Romans 1:21) and how such rejection has caused their minds to concoct unspeakable evils, such as idolatry and sodomy

(v. 27). In Psalm 10:7, David describes the wickedness of people’s motives and speech, which leads to abuses of power in their relationships with their fellow man.

Before we can ever get people saved, we must get them lost. Who among us does not see within himself the awful fruits of rebellion these chapters describe? Let us thank God today that He is willing to forgive our past and to accept us as His very own children. We should be so grateful that we would never entertain the thought of turning our backs on Him."
07-14,07-14,195,"Don’t you realize how kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Or don’t you care? Can’t you see how kind he has been in giving you time to turn from your sin? ",Romans 2:4,"God’s kindness leads to repentance. We once were lost, irretrievable sinners, but when we realize that God still loves us enough to forgive us in Christ, it will break our wills and cause us to cry out to Him for mercy.

David was so overwhelmed by God’s kindness in promising to bless his future household that he exclaimed, “Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far? And now, O God, in addition to everything else, you speak of giving me a lasting dynasty! You speak as though I were someone very great, O Lord God” (1 Chronicles 17:16-17). Such honor and kindness from God made David a humble, not proud, man.

Paul demolished the idea that God’s goodness grants a person self-righteousness. The Jews he so often preached to felt this way when comparing themselves to the Gentiles (Romans 2). We must never fail to remember that we are no better than anyone else, and if not for the kindness of God, we would be just like everyone else!

Be humbled today over the fact that, in His kindness, God has forgiven you. Never let that forgiveness be perverted into an attitude of superiority. Stay repentant and ever grateful that He has transformed your life. This continual gratitude and repentance will keep you from pride and religious arrogance from now until you see Him face-to-face!"
07-15,07-15,196,"But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying what it is worth. I cannot take what is yours and give it to the Lord. I will not offer a burnt offering that has cost me nothing!” ",1 Chronicles 21:24,"David insisted on paying the full price for Araunah’s threshing floor. The idea of making an offering to God with no personal sacrifice involved repulsed David. His God was entirely too holy and worthy to be offered a cheap sacrifice.

Many Christians are looking for the “bargain table,” where they can serve the Lord with little or no personal change in their lifestyles or comfort levels. The Bible tells of many such people, who desired the environment of religion without the demonstration of true love for God or man.

All love is shown by personal sacrifice. Jesus vividly portrayed His love for us by paying the full price for our sin. He took no shortcuts or easy roads to purchase our redemption. Willingly, He drank the full cup of God’s wrath. He’s asking us today, “Have you resigned everything to Me and counted it as loss that you might gain Me? Are you willing to pay the full price?”

God takes seemingly insignificant sacrifices and uses them to build His mighty kingdom. David had no idea that his little seed of sacrifice at the threshing floor of Araunah would ultimately lead to the establishment of Solomon’s temple at that very site (2 Chronicles 3:1).

What have you offered to the Lord in loving sacrifice?"
07-16,07-16,197,"Therefore, Lord, we know you will protect the oppressed, preserving them forever from this lying generation, even though the wicked strut about, and evil is praised throughout the land. ",Psalm 12:7-8,"How proud and cocky are those who seek to oppress believers! Paul aptly describes their actions: “Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave. Their speech is filled with lies. The poison of a deadly snake drips from their lips. Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. They are quick to commit murder” (Romans 3:13-15).

Christians need not worry, however, for the boasting of such evildoers against the righteous incites the Lord to action: “Now I will rise up. . . .”(Psalm 12:5). God’s remedy for persecuted, defeated believers is simply to supply them with the words of the Lord. God’s Word is flawless, like “silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over” (Psalm 12:6).

In your battle, stop running to God to complain about your problem. Find His pure Word that He gave you to defeat your enemies, and rise up in victory over them. Others’ advice may be helpful, but only the Word of God will put the devil to flight, as it is “the sword of the Spirit” (Ephesians 6:17). Employ the sword of God’s Spirit, and watch your proud enemies flee in terror!"
07-17,07-17,198,Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him. ,Psalm 127:3,"Heman’s fourteen sons were given to him through the promises of God to honor him (1 Chronicles 25:5 NIV). The Bible records that Heman’s children were the product of his faith in the promises of God. Heman received these gifts by believing that God would give him children and that they would be a blessing. These fourteen sons were all gifted in music, and their excellence served to honor their father (1 Chronicles 25:5-7).

In the New Testament, we also see this same pattern of godly children that are a blessing to their parents. Philip had four virgin daughters who prophesied and whose ministry was a great reflection on Philip’s family and life. His children, like Heman’s, brought honor to their father’s name.

The children of the godly are a blessing (Psalm 37:26). They are a gift—not a curse! Our children have been given to us by the promises of God, and Satan cannot use their lives to bring us shame and dishonor. Secure in the promises of God, we should expect our children to honor us, not to embarrass us.

Let us expect all our children to know and serve the Lord and to bring us great delight as they walk before Him with all their hearts!"
07-18,07-18,199,"Abraham never wavered in believing God’s promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God. He was absolutely convinced that God was able to do anything he promised. ",Romans 4:20-21,"The King James Version of this verse says Abraham was “fully persuaded” (v. 21). When you are dealing with something as impossible as having a child at the age of one hundred, your faith must be rock-solid! Abraham faced the fact that his body was dead (Romans 4:19), but he did not allow that consideration to weaken his faith. He came to a point in which his beliefs did not waver and he was “fully persuaded.”

When confronted with an impossibility, you must face the facts with the truth, which is embodied in the promises of God. As you spend time meditating on the promises of God, you will become “fully persuaded.” His promises will so saturate your mind and thinking that you will no longer waver in doubt when looking at outward circumstances. Rather, your heart will be convinced and remain fixed, regardless of what your mind thinks. Your heart will overflow with a faith that knows God has the power to do what He has promised. At that point, nothing the devil can do or say will move you from your position of faith.

Keep reading, studying, and digging into God’s promises. Persist in tearing down any area of unbelief, until you are “fully persuaded.”"
07-19,07-19,200,"I know, my God, that you examine our hearts and rejoice when you find integrity there. You know I have done all this with good motives, and I have watched your people offer their gifts willingly and joyously. ",1 Chronicles 29:17,"Giving is based on motives, and in 1 Chronicles 29 David listed the right reasons for giving to God. First, he spoke about his own giving (vv. 2-3). Leaders have no business instructing others to give if they themselves have not given!

Second, David challenged the leaders under him to give, and they responded willingly. Joyfully they provided an abundance of gold, silver, bronze, iron, and precious stones for the construction of the temple (vv. 7-8).  Because they had given freely and generously from their hearts, King David was filled with joy (v. 9).

Third, David motivated the congregation to give. David reminded them in his prayer before them that everything comes from God (v. 14) and that they were only giving back to Him what He had given them in the first place. He then recalled the fact that they were only aliens passing through this world, using their earthly resources for a limited time called life (v. 15).

Finally, David revealed that he had given with pure motives in the integrity of his heart, with no desire to impress or manipulate others

(v. 17). That made his giving acceptable to God.

Why should we greedily grasp for the passing things of this life when they will only slip through our fingers on the day we enter eternity? If our giving follows the guidelines David laid out, the Kingdom of God will be financed properly, sacrificially, and abundantly!"
07-20,07-20,201,I will bless the Lord who guides me; even at night my heart instructs me. ,Psalm 16:7,"At night, when our hearts are still, God speaks to us. To Solomon, God appeared with a fantastic question, one that we could only dream about someone asking us: “What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!” (2 Chronicles 1:7).

Solomon’s request should forever instruct us in what is truly important. Instead of asking for riches, long life, or the destruction of his enemies, his simple request was for more wisdom to care for the people of God. Anyone who puts the purposes of God and His people ahead of his own personal fortunes and fame will instantly win the favor of the Lord.

“And he will give you all you need from day to day if you live for him and make the Kingdom of God your primary concern” (Matthew 6:33). Let us ask God for wisdom—not to make money or to control others, but to be able to administrate His kingdom with precision. When our hearts are separated from the world, God will give us the finances, physical health, and other things we need to help us accomplish our heart’s desire for Him."
07-21,07-21,202,"The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised the Lord with these words: “He is so good! His faithful love endures forever!” At that moment a cloud filled the Temple of the Lord. ",2 Chronicles 5:13,"In music, sounds that blend together are called harmony, or symphony. If individual tones and instruments do not blend, they clash, producing cacophony. Imagine the awful noise if all the instruments in an orchestra played their own notes in completely different keys! But when all the instruments work together, the result is a beautiful piece of music that uplifts the human soul.

God has called each of us, with our individual tones and ministries, to blend into one body. The result will be as it was at the dedication of Solomon’s temple: a beautiful display of unity—not one individual note or instrument that clashes with others, but a conscious blending of our gifts and callings with that of others.

Psalm 133:3 expresses it perfectly: “Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon that falls on the mountains of Zion. And the Lord has pronounced his blessing, even life forevermore” (Psalm 133:3). Whatever calling, church, or ministry we are involved in, we must walk in unity with everyone else. Then we can watch the effectiveness of our ministry multiply and see the glory of God displayed for a listening world."
07-22,07-22,203,"Now, O Lord, God of Israel, fulfill the promise to your servant David. ",2 Chronicles 6:17,"Solomon prayed that God’s promises to his father David would come to pass. The King James Version says Solomon wanted God’s promises verified. The word verify means “to establish as a fact,” or “to prove true.” Scientists verify their hypotheses by hundreds of tests. Detectives verify evidence by examining it from every conceivable angle.

Faith means to believe God to establish His promise as a fact. You build your faith by searching out the promises of God until you have established, or verified, them as facts in your mind, not just as promises. When you establish God’s Word as fact, He will then establish your life by fulfilling His promises: “Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established” (2 Chronicles 20:20 KJV).

Whatever crisis you are facing, make the effort to verify the promises of God that pertain to that situation. Find every shred of biblical evidence that fits your case. Meditate on that evidence until it turns from a promise into an established fact in your heart. As you establish God’s promises, He will establish you!"
07-23,07-23,204,"And since we are his children, we will share his treasures—for everything God gives to His Son, Christ, is ours, too. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering. ",Romans 8:17,"The Holy Spirit has come to dwell within us as the “first installment of everything he will give us” (2 Corinthians 1:22), or as the guarantee of our eternal inheritance (2 Corinthians 5:5). He is the “down payment” of our heavenly inheritance, where we will receive the full manifestation of our sonship and adoption (Romans 8:19).

All that happens to us in this life is “training for reigning,” mere preparation for the time when we will rule and reign with Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit within us is our Helper, the One preparing us to reign with Christ. When we encounter spiritual attacks, the Holy Spirit helps us to pray and overcome. Therefore, everything we are going through now is simply maturing us and preparing us for dominion in eternity.

If we have identified with Christ’s sufferings and fought life through, the eternal day will come when we will share His glory. We will be seated on thrones with Him. “I will invite everyone who is victorious to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat with my Father on his throne” (Revelation 3:21)."
07-24,07-24,205,I chased my enemies and caught them; I did not stop until they were conquered. I struck them down so they could not get up; they fell beneath my feet. ,Psalm 18:37-38,"David recounts how God gave him overwhelming victory over any and every enemy that attacked him. He did not enter into agreements with his attackers—he defeated them!

You must begin to see your spiritual enemies as they truly are— already defeated in Christ and subject to your spiritual authority. Make no compromises and take no prisoners! Be ruthless against every high thought that exalts itself above the knowledge of God (2 Corinthians 10:5), never wavering in your spiritual warfare against God’s enemies.

Paul states that in all these things you are more than a conqueror through Him who loved you (Romans 8:37). Declare with him, “And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love. Death can’t, and life can’t. The angels can’t, and the demons can’t. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can’t keep God’s love away. Whether we are high above the sky or in the deepest ocean, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord” (vv. 38-39).

Go forward against your enemies, and don’t stop until they have been crushed under your feet!"
07-25,07-25,206,"Then Asa cried out to the Lord his God, “O Lord, no one but you can help the powerless against the mighty! Help us, O Lord our God, for we trust in you alone. It is in your name that we have come against this vast horde. O Lord, you are our God; do not let mere men prevail against you!” ",2 Chronicles 14:11,"How sad it is to see a person move from having a tender heart and complete trust in God to having a cold, hard heart and an analytical mind that calculates every move.

Unfortunately, that is just what happened to Asa.  He began his reign with a mighty victory, totally relying upon the Lord to defeat the Ethiopians. At the end of his reign, however, when he had grown old and was no longer childlike in his faith, he hired mercenary soldiers to fight his battles. The prophet rebuked him for his unbelief, reminding him that “the eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9).

Asa’s unbelieving attitude was also evident in his latter years when he “developed a serious foot disease. Even when the disease became life threatening, he did not seek the Lord’s help but sought help only from his physicians. So he died in the forty-first year of his reign” (2 Chronicles 16:12-13). How far Asa had strayed from the time when the whole nation sought the Lord and God gave him “rest from his enemies” (2 Chronicles 14:6)! He now focused his hope on the efforts of man rather than the power of God. Asa was not wrong to seek the help of physicians, but he did err in placing his trust in them rather than in the Lord.

Let us purpose to stay simple, trusting, and childlike in total dependence upon God for all our days."
07-26,07-26,207,"Salvation that comes from trusting Christ—which is the message we preach—is already within easy reach. In fact, the Scriptures say, “The message is close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart.” ",Romans 10:8,"In this scripture, Paul reveals the connection between your mouth and your heart in the expression of your faith. Jesus said, “For whatever is in your heart determines what you say” (Matthew 12:34). Clearly, Jesus is the Word (John 1:1); therefore, when you speak the Word, you are speaking Jesus into your situation.

Faith begins in the heart, a heart that is fully persuaded that the promises of God are true. Once such faith is deep within your heart, your mouth will begin to reflect that faith by the words you say.

Whatever you believe in your heart about Jesus, you confess with your mouth. You believe that God raised Jesus from the dead, and you confess, “Jesus is Lord.” You believe that Jesus paid for your healing, and you confess, “Jesus is my Healer.” You believe that Jesus is your Provider, and you confess, “Jesus is my Shepherd.”

If you call upon the name of the Lord in faith, you will receive that promise for salvation, blessing, healing, or deliverance. After you receive the promise, speak the Word and watch Jesus show up on the scene!"
07-27,07-27,208,"Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army from Edom is marching against you from beyond the Dead Sea. They are already at Hazazon-tamar.” (This was another name for En-gedi.) Jehoshaphat was alarmed by this news and sought the Lord for guidance. He also gave orders that everyone throughout Judah should observe a fast. ",2 Chronicles 20:2-3,"Jehoshaphat received a bad report! A negative report can knock you down, as illustrated through the bad report given by the ten spies in Moses’ day. Your response to a bad report is critical, as it often determines the outcome of the situation.

Jehoshaphat’s response teaches several lessons. First, don’t respond in fear, but in faith (2 Chronicles 20:3). Second, find a promise that fits your case and stand upon that promise, using it as the basis of your prayer (v. 9). Third, based upon that same promise, claim your inheritance and stand your ground, resisting all “claim jumpers” (v. 11). Fourth, turn the battle over to God (v. 15). Finally, praise God for the victory in advance (vv. 21-22).

The world views a bad report as the definitive statement of fact regarding a matter. As a Christian, however, you know that you can reverse an evil report. Jehoshaphat’s ordeal was transformed from the dreadful fear and alarm of the first report to the joyful, triumphal return to Jerusalem.

The same battle plan that Jehoshaphat used will work for you. Fear not, find a promise, claim your inheritance, turn the battle over to God, and praise Him in advance. You will surely win!"
07-28,07-28,209,"My life is poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax, melting within me. ",Psalm 22:14,"All of us get “out of joint” occasionally—with our spouses, with the Church, with other people, and sometimes even with the Lord. We don’t mean to be that way. We don’t anticipate our actions or feelings, but we find ourselves in dissension with others to whom we really are connected.

In speaking of the human body, Paul said, “The whole body is fitted together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love” (Ephesians 4:16). When we get out of joint with the rest of the Body of Christ, we no longer supply what others need, nor do we submit to the Head, who is Christ. We cause ourselves, as well as those to whom we are connected, much pain.

The remedy? One who “is overcome by some sin” (Galatians 6:1) should be restored gently by those who are spiritual. Such a person is still part of the Body of Christ, and we need him. We must always remember to deal in the spirit of meekness with one who is out of joint, because our Lord Himself paid the price when His bones were all out of joint!

Get back “in joint” with your spouse and Christian friends. Jesus is the “Joint” that joins you!"
07-29,07-29,210,"Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what should I do about the silver I paid to hire the army of Israel?” The man of God replied, “The Lord is able to give you much more than this!” ",2 Chronicles 25:9,"Amaziah learned the lesson of unquestioning obedience. He had already invested one hundred talents of silver to hire ungodly mercenary troops from Israel for help in the battle against Edom. Then the prophet instructed him to refuse any allies that were not on the Lord’s side, even if they had already been paid. Amaziah faced a tough choice: to lose his investment and follow God, or keep his investment and be on his own.

Losing a job, money, or investments is never as great a loss as that of losing the presence of God. Paul admonishes, “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will know what God wants you to do, and you will know how good and pleasing and perfect his will really is” (Romans 12:2).

Life is full of tough decisions in which you must choose between God’s will and apparent wealth, fame, or strength. In actuality, the Lord can give you much more than anything you sacrifice for Him (2 Chronicles 25:10). Never value any worldly thing more than you value being in the peace and rest of God. Choose God’s way, for as Romans

8:31 promises, if God is for you, who can be against you?"
07-30,07-30,211,". . . And as long as the king sought the Lord, God gave him success. ",2 Chronicles 26:5,"We can almost always trace our successes and failures to our seeking of God. When we are humble and childlike, we sense our total dependence upon and hunger for God. Prayer becomes easy and natural because we are so dependent. When we become proud and self-sufficient, however, we stop praying and start acting.

The Lord helped Uzziah “wonderfully until he became very powerful. But when he had become powerful, he also became proud, which led to his downfall. . . .” (2 Chronicles 26:15-16). Satan trapped Uzziah in the same snare that he himself had fallen into in eternity past. Pride had caused Satan to be cast out of heaven, and pride caused Uzziah to be cast out of the temple. As a result of his arrogant attitude and defiant spirit toward the priests of God, Uzziah developed terminal leprosy. If only he had remained childlike, humble, and dependent!

Our prayer lives reveal our heart attitudes. Therefore, we need to keep seeking the Lord, even if our minds tell us we have “made it.” God may be checking out our dependence attitudes!"
07-31,07-31,212,"Accept Christians who are weak in faith, and don’t argue with them about what they think is right or wrong. ",Romans 14:1,"What should we do when two Christians’ convictions differ and each person’s heart is pure? Paul teaches us to defer to our convicted brother in order to avoid offending him. We are not to look down on a brother whose conscience bothers him in a certain area, even though our conscience does not bother us in that same area. Instead, we are to accept him whose faith is weak.

Why should Christians or a church break fellowship with someone over things that are only earthly or temporal? We should major on what the Holy Spirit majors on: righteousness, peace, and joy (Romans 14:17). We must let our brother or sister follow his or her conscience, and we must follow ours without brazenly displaying our actions for the purpose of argument. The important thing is the person, not the issue in question. “And if another Christian is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don’t let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died” (v. 15).

“Those whose hands and hearts are pure” (Psalm 24:5) are allowed to “climb the mountain of the Lord” (v. 4). One day in heaven, the temporal disagreements of earth will be forever settled, and Jesus will be the only thing that matters."
08-01,08-01,213,"For even Christ didn’t please himself. As the Scriptures say, “Those who insult you are also insulting me.” ",Romans 15:3,"Jesus spent His life bearing the insults of those who insulted God. King Hezekiah’s messengers received much the same reaction in the tribes of Israel when they presented the invitation to return to the Lord and celebrate Passover (2 Chronicles 30:10).

To the backslidden Israelites, the archaic idea of a Passover in Jerusalem was absurd. The messengers sincerely tried to turn the Israelites’ hearts back to God, but the results were the same in village after village: “But most of the people just laughed at the messengers and made fun of them” (v. 10). However, the Scripture records that “some . . . humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem” (v. 11).

If we just want to please ourselves, we will not venture out into the stream of evangelism where our feelings may get hurt. The burden of evangelism, however, belongs to God, and if we love Him, we will be willing to “bear the disgrace he bore” (Hebrews 13:13). We must realize that we are simply messengers delivering an invitation that others can either accept or reject. If Jesus was reproached, so must we be.

Rejoice if men ridicule you. You are bearing the insults of God!"
08-02,08-02,214,"Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. Do this because of your love for me, given to you by the Holy Spirit. ",Romans 15:30,"Prayer is the key that overcomes the enemy in battle. Hezekiah prayed on two different occasions and thus overcame tremendous struggles. First, he and Isaiah prayed against the invasion by Sennacherib (2 Chronicles 32:20), and God sent His angel to completely destroy the enemy’s army. Then, in a struggle for his life, Hezekiah sought God, and God healed him in answer to his prayer

(v. 24).

Manasseh, too, experienced the power of prayer to change a difficult situation. While in a Babylonian jail, he prayed to the Lord, and God miraculously delivered him and restored him to power. What powerful illustrations of prayer and its ability to release God’s deliverance these examples are!

Paul understood this principle of prayer when he asked the Romans to struggle with him in prayer that he might be “rescued from those in Judea who refuse to obey God” (Romans 15:31). David voiced a similar prayer: “Protect me! Rescue my life from them! Do not let me be disgraced, for I trust in you” (Psalm 25:20).

Your spiritual leaders need your prayers. Pray diligently today for them to be protected, fruitful, and refreshed. Your prayers may save their lives!"
08-03,08-03,215,The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. ,Romans 16:20,"You are promised victory! God is the God of peace, and it is His desire for you to have peace like a river in all areas of your life. Satan comes in to interrupt that peace and tranquility, but God is with you to help you crush Satan. Not only will you bruise him, but you will actually crush him!

Besides being promised that you will ultimately crush Satan, you are promised it will happen soon. This word means “quickly,” “in haste,” “speedily,” or “shortly.” God will not leave believers fighting Satan forever, but “will grant justice to them quickly!” (Luke 18:8).

Finally, the Holy Spirit describes the position in which Satan belongs: under your feet! Jesus told His disciples, “I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you” (Luke 10:19).

Pursue the devil until he falls, and then crush him under your feet! Then you can boldly proclaim with the psalmist, “I have taken a stand, and I will publicly praise the Lord” (Psalm 26:12)."
08-04,08-04,216,"He will keep you strong right up to the end, and he will keep you free from all blame on the great day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns. God will surely do this for you, for he always does just what he says. . . .",1 Corinthians 1:8-9,"This is a promise of God’s faithfulness to His own. All day—day in, day out, year in, and year out—God’s faithfulness is great. Man, in his stubbornness and rebellion, may drift away from God, but through it all, “He remains faithful” (2 Timothy 2:13).

No matter what difficulty life throws your way, God has promised to

“keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you can’t stand up against it. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it” (1 Corinthians 10:13). David was so convinced of the faithfulness of God that he could say, “Though a mighty army surrounds me, my heart will know no fear. Even if they attack me, I remain confident” (Psalm 27:3).

On the other hand, God is faithful to execute His judgment upon those who reject Him even after He has repeatedly warned them to repent. Gradually, but surely, He tightens the screws of justice until the person repents or brings about his own destruction.

As hard as it is to believe, some people actually do choose the path of destruction. In 2 Chronicles 36:13, we read that “Zedekiah was a hard and stubborn man, refusing to turn to the Lord, the God of Israel.” Following his example, the people of Israel grew more and more unfaithful, ignoring God’s repeated warnings until finally “the Lord’s anger could no longer be restrained and there was no remedy” (2 Chronicles 36:16).

If life is uncertain right now, cling to the one certainty: God is faithful! You can be sure that “He will keep you strong right up to the end” (1 Corinthians 1:8)."
08-05,08-05,217,"Don’t say, “I will get even for this wrong.” Wait for the Lord to handle the matter. ",Proverbs 20:22,"How difficult it is for our flesh to sit and wait! This proverb implores us not to take matters of revenge into our own hands and say, “I’ll pay you back for this!” God’s pace of justice is far slower than ours. He is long-suffering and full of grace, while we, on the contrary, are quick to judge and swift to repay.

David said, “Wait patiently for the Lord. Be brave and courageous. Yes, wait patiently for the Lord” (Psalm 27:14). Had Abram waited on the Lord for his miracle son, he would not have ventured into the fleshly union with Hagar (Genesis 16). The result of his impatience remains with us today in the ongoing problems in the Middle East.

The two lessons we must learn in order to obtain a promise are faith and patience (Hebrews 6:12). A large part of faith is simply refusing to yield to the thought that God somehow will be late. Though he may have felt nervous on the outside, David stayed confident on the inside. He waited patiently for God to act and said, “Yet I am confident that I will see the Lord’s goodness while I am here in the land of the living” (Psalm 27:13).

You, too, will see the Lord’s goodness if you learn to patiently wait upon Him in faith."
08-06,08-06,218,"When the builders completed the foundation of the Lord’s Temple, the priests put on their robes and took their places to blow their trumpets. And the Levites, descendants of Asaph, clashed their cymbals to praise the Lord, just as King David had prescribed. ",Ezra 3:10,"What a sight it must have been when the song of the Lord was again sung in Jerusalem for the first time in almost a century! Seventy years of captivity in cruel Babylon gave way to a restoration of praise and worship. With praise, thanksgiving, and shouting, the people of God jubilantly rejoiced, saying, “He is so good! His faithful love for Israel endures forever!” (Ezra 3:11).

Even today God is restoring praise and worship to His Church. Ezra 3:13 tells us that “the joyful shouting and weeping mingled together in a loud commotion that could be heard far in the distance.” And so will our praise be heard by a lost world that is waiting for some sound of the joy of the Lord.

Satan hates the praises of God, for they represent a regathered people, a determined people, and an evangelistic people. Also, some people will not understand our praise because the man without the Spirit does not understand those things that come from the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2:14).

Praise releases the waiting hand of God. Decide today to stay in the “praising crowd.” After all, that is your destiny throughout all eternity!"
08-07,08-07,219,But there is going to come a time of testing at the judgment day to see what kind of work each builder has done. Everyone’s work will be put through the fire to see whether or not it keeps its value. ,1 Corinthians 3:13,"Ezra and his companions labored to reconstruct the temple at Jerusalem. When their actions were brought to the attention of Darius the king, he approved the building project. Furthermore, he supplied all the necessary materials for construction, while the people provided the work.

Ezra worked to rebuild a physical temple, but you are working on a spiritual temple (1 Corinthians 3:10). God Himself has provided the foundation, the equipment, and the materials in His Son, Jesus Christ. You are God’s fellow worker, laboring to build on this foundation the types of works that will stand the test of time and eternity. “If the work survives the fire, that builder will receive a reward. But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builders themselves will be saved, but like someone escaping through a wall of flames” (vv. 14-15).

Your work for God will become the most important thing to you the moment you stand before the judgment seat of Christ. If your work on earth was hasty, superficial, and self-exalting, it will be destroyed. If it was deep, rooted in love, and glorifying only Christ, it will last.

This spiritual temple you are building is all that is worthy of your life’s work, so give it your all. You will enjoy the rewards of your work for eternity."
08-08,08-08,220,So look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God’s secrets. ,1 Corinthians 4:1,"What a stewardship we have! Paul said that he was Christ’s servant, entrusted with the secret things of God. Similarly, Ezra and his men were told to deliver unto the God of Jerusalem those things that were entrusted to them for worship in God’s temple (Ezra 7:19).

Just as the precious gold and silver articles of the temple were entrusted to Ezra, so we have been entrusted with the deep secrets of the doctrines of God: justification, sanctification, and glorification.

“Now, a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful”

(1 Corinthians 4:2), and we are to treasure the truths we have been given by the Holy Spirit.

No careless hands touched the precious temple articles, but they were carefully preserved and protected until they reached Jerusalem. We must reverently carry the truths of the Christian faith, viewing them as more precious than gold, silver, or diamonds.

Let us hold the gifts, doctrines, and ministries we have received with faithful hands, and one day we will deliver them safely to the New Jerusalem and present them to the One who entrusted us with them."
08-09,08-09,221,"How terrible that you should boast about your spirituality, and yet you let this sort of thing go on. Don’t you realize that if even one person is allowed to go on sinning, soon all will be affected? ",1 Corinthians 5:6,"Ezra realized that if he tolerated the intermarriage of Israelites with foreign women, eventually the holy seed would become extinct and the Messiah would never come (Ezra 9:2). Just as Ezra was appalled at the Israelites’ terrible breach of God’s law, Paul was equally horrified that sin had crept into the church at Corinth. He ordered the excommunication of the one who was in open, unrepentant sin so that the Body of Christ could participate in a pure Passover feast.

Just a little bit of yeast will cause the dough to rise, and a little sin mixed into a church will cause it to be filled with the “bread of wickedness and evil” (1 Corinthians 5:8). We must separate ourselves from any so-called brother who continues to sin through immorality, greed, thievery, or idolatry.

Separating ourselves from unrepentant sin benefits not only us but also the whole Church. The end result? The Church will be protected, and perhaps the offender will repent and be saved (1 Corinthians 5:5)."
08-10,08-10,222,". . . You do not belong to yourself, for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body. ",1 Corinthians 6:19-20,"Your body is a temporary house that you occupy before moving into eternity. The body itself is not evil, only the sinful nature that manipulates it. Concerning the human body, Paul first taught the Corinthians that their bodies were “actually parts of Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:15). It would be unthinkable to take Christ’s body and place it in an immoral situation! In the same way, you must consider your body as respectfully as you would Christ’s own body.

Second, Paul stated that the body is the “temple of the Holy Spirit”

(v. 19). To use it in outward sin, therefore, obviously grieves Him. If you consider an earthly temple as holy, how much more should you respect a temple where the Holy Spirit is physically present!

Finally, Paul says, “You were bought at a price.” Your body is worth the highest price ever paid for anything—the blood of Jesus. If God sets such a high price on your body, how much more should you cherish it!

Value your body, and don’t cheapen it with immorality. Refuse to yield it to the desires of the sinful nature. Keep it pure, and one day it will be glorified like Jesus’ body."
08-11,08-11,223,"You hide them in the shelter of your presence, safe from those who conspire against them. You shelter them in your presence, far from accusing tongues. ",Psalm 31:20,"Nehemiah found a waiting enemy in Sanballat. As soon as Sanballat heard about Nehemiah’s intentions to rebuild Jerusalem, he and his cronies mocked and ridiculed Nehemiah (Nehemiah 4:1-3).

Whenever you launch out for God in obedience to His Word, the devil will be right there to tell you how foolish you are to even consider such an idea. He points to those who have tried the same thing but failed. He questions your motives, accusing you of only wanting recognition. He laughs at you in hopes that you will never start, for he knows that when you are resolved to finish, “the God of heaven will help [you] succeed” (Nehemiah 2:20).

For Nehemiah, when the battle was over and the wall rebuilt, he could say with David, “Praise the Lord, for he has shown me his unfailing love. He kept me safe when my city was under attack” (Psalm 31:21).

Whatever you are doing for the Lord, “be strong and take courage, all you who put your hope in the Lord” (Psalm 31:24). Let the enemy ridicule, scorn, and mock, but God will have the last laugh!"
08-12,08-12,224,"During this time, none of us . . . ever took off our clothes. We carried our weapons with us at all times, even when we went for water. ",Nehemiah 4:23,"Have you ever been in a pitched battle? Nehemiah was! As he neared the end of constructing the wall, he remained ever vigilant.  He never took off his armor in the day of battle and kept his weapon with him at all times. Relaxation was not an option.

At times the spiritual warfare in life can reach a fever pitch. Satan knows when you are approaching a breakthrough threshold in the advancement of the Kingdom of Christ. But just like a sports team that fights hardest in a goal-line stand, you’ve got to hold steady and remain firm in the fiercest moment of battle.

As Paul said, “Use every piece of God’s armor to resist the enemy in the time of evil, so that after the battle you will still be standing firm”

(Ephesians 6:13). When you are facing a crisis and engaged in spiritual warfare, don’t stop battling the devil until the breakthrough comes. There will be plenty of time for rest when the battle is won!"
08-13,08-13,225,"Remember, O my God, all that I have done for these people, and bless me for it. ",Nehemiah 5:19,"Integrity is the missing ingredient in many leaders today. Nehemiah, however, taught and modeled a sacrificial lifestyle that was above reproach. Although he had a right to be pampered, he refused to place a heavy burden on the people (Nehemiah 5:15). Although others had lorded it over the people, Nehemiah devoted himself to the work on the wall (v. 16). In addition, he never demanded the fine food allotted to him as governor (v. 18). He was a man of rare integrity who led by his example.

A life of integrity demands a lifestyle of accountability that involves one’s money, priorities, and motives. God was so blessed by Job’s integrity that He described him as “the finest man in all the earth—a man of complete integrity” (Job 2:3). In the New Testament, Peter reminded the elders not to be greedy for money, but eager to serve; not to lord it over those entrusted to them, but to be examples to the flock (1 Peter 5:2-3).

Those you lead can tell if your heart is influenced by the work or the benefits of the work. If you aspire to leadership, seek integrity. God will be sure to make a place for you!"
08-14,08-14,226,"Don’t be dejected and sad, for the joy of the Lord is your strength! ",Nehemiah 8:10,"A sad Christian is no witness for God. Ezra read the Book of the Law to the Jewish remnant, and when they heard God’s words, “all the people chanted, ‘Amen! Amen!’ as they lifted their hands toward heaven. Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground” (Nehemiah 8:6).

Why should church services and times of preaching be times of sadness and boredom? When the people wept after hearing God’s words, Nehemiah told them, “Go and celebrate with a feast of choice foods and sweet drinks, and share gifts of food with people who have nothing prepared” (v. 10). The Israelites obeyed and celebrated “with great joy because they had heard God’s words and understood them”

(v. 12)

Later that month, in celebrating a major festival that had been unobserved for many years, the people lived in booths for seven days, and “everyone was filled with great joy” (v. 17). Another observance followed, and this time for six hours at a time the Levites led in worship, saying, “Stand up and praise the Lord your God, for he lives from everlasting to everlasting!” Then they continued, “Praise his glorious name! It is far greater than we can think or say” (9:5).

Why should Christians ever lose their joy? Someone has said that if the devil can’t steal your joy, he can’t spoil your goods. Even in your most difficult moments, look to eternity, where you will forever rejoice, world without end. Take a drink today from the joy of heaven, for it is your strength!"
08-15,08-15,227,"I will praise the Lord at all times. I will constantly speak his praises. I will boast only in the Lord; let all who are discouraged take heart. Come, let us tell of the Lord’s greatness; let us exalt his name together. ",Psalm 34:1-3,"David tells us three things we must do to emerge victorious from troubles. First, he tells us to praise the Lord (Psalm 34:1). When we bless the Lord for all His benefits, boast in the Lord concerning His attributes, and exalt Him for His goodness, we are focusing on Him instead of our troubles. How easy it is, though, to let trouble take over our thinking to the point that we forget how great God is!

Second, David tells us to seek the Lord (v. 4 KJV). To seek means “to inquire diligently,” or “to reach a place of desperation.” David knew this kind of desperate crying out to God and the results it brought: “This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles” (v. 6 KJV). Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, Moses stretched out his rod, Peter put on his sandals . . . and God delivered from sickness, danger, and imprisonment!

Finally, David said to reverence the Lord (v. 9). We must examine every area of our lives to be certain our giving, our words, and our relationships are in order. In this way, we honor God.

When we praise the Lord, seek the Lord, and reverence the Lord, we will be delivered from all our troubles!"
08-16,08-16,228,The Lord is close to the brokenhearted; he rescues those who are crushed in spirit. ,Psalm 34:18,"So often when we walk through a crushing experience, we feel like God is a million miles away. The enemy tells us that God does not care and is not interested in our problems. David reminds us, however, that God is nearest to us when we are broken in heart.

When the earth was dark and without form, the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters (Genesis 1:2). Never forget: Whenever your life seems dark and no solution is in sight, the Spirit of God is actually hovering over you, guarding you in the midst of trial.

Someone once said, “When you have a broken heart, you must give God the broken part.” David gave God his broken heart in repentance after his sin with Bathsheba and reminded God that “the sacrifice you want is a broken spirit. A broken and repentant heart, O God, you will not despise” (Psalm 51:17). God responded by healing David’s broken heart and restoring his soul.

You must bring your broken heart to God and let Him heal it, for a “broken spirit saps a person’s strength” (Proverbs 17:22). Go to Jesus with your broken heart, for He was anointed to “comfort the brokenhearted” (Isaiah 61:1). Why not reach out and ask the Holy Spirit to touch you where no human surgeon can? He is near. Let Him do His work right now."
08-17,08-17,229,". . . Eliashib the priest, who had been appointed as supervisor of the storerooms of the Temple of our God and who was also a relative of Tobiah, had converted a large storage room and placed it at Tobiah’s disposal. ",Nehemiah 13:4-5,"How quickly the enemy tries to sneak back into areas we have removed him from in the past! In the first chapters of Nehemiah, we see a man named Tobiah causing Nehemiah great problems. Nehemiah defeated him, yet sometime later we find Tobiah living in the temple where the tithes and offerings were kept!

We should never lose our vigilance in fighting the devil. If we relax after a victory, he will try to sneak in the back door and continue his wickedness. Peter instructed us to be on guard against the devil because “he prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for some victim to devour” (1 Peter 5:8).

Any house left vacant gradually falls into ruin. When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem, he found that the tithes had not been paid, and the duties of the priesthood had been neglected. In addition, the people had failed to keep the Sabbath and had even intermarried with the heathen (Nehemiah 13:9-25).

Because Satan always returns to a house that is unoccupied even though cleansed (Matthew 12:44), we must guard our souls against his counterattacks. He is like a crocodile stalking its prey, probing for an opportunity to attack and waiting for the relaxation of vigilance. Let’s stand our ground and watch carefully, throwing him out at the slightest sign of reentry!"
08-18,08-18,230,"When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down or show him respect, he was filled with rage. So he decided it was not enough to lay hands on Mordecai alone. Since he had learned that Mordecai was a Jew, he decided to destroy all the Jews throughout the entire empire of Xerxes. ",Esther 3:5-6,"Society’s hatred for the Jews has always been extreme and inexplicable. The magnitude of their suffering defies reason. The fact remains, however, that Satan knew salvation (Jesus) would come from the Jews, and thus he sought at every turn to destroy the Jewish people.

The Jews’ worship of the true God and their rejection of idolatry led Mordecai to refuse to worship any human being (Esther 3:5). Haman’s well-conceived plot looked foolproof, but God had been engineering a rescue operation about which Haman knew nothing. Working her way up to the right hand of the king was a little orphan (Esther), who would ultimately be the tool of deliverance in the hand of God.

Satan is enraged by anyone who refuses to bow down and worship him, and he will do whatever he can to destroy such a person.  Satan’s best plans, however, are no match for God, who knows the end from the beginning and the “way out” of the problem before the “way in” even existed!

Stand still and wait on God, for He has known the solution to your problem since before it came into existence!"
08-19,08-19,231,"If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honored, all the parts are glad. ",1 Corinthians 12:26,"Paul shows us that we are a totally interrelated body, not just independent parts thrown together. No part of the human body can continue to function normally when one part is in pain. The whole body focuses its attention on the area afflicted. In the same way, Mordecai sent word to Esther not to think that just because she lived in the palace she would escape the sentence of death imposed on the Jews (Esther 4:13). If she did not help, she would be destroyed, too.

Our influences and gifts are given to us by God to help others for “such a time as this” (Esther 4:14). Let us take inventory of the positions, finances, and grace of God in our lives and see whom those gifts were intended to help. If we keep them for ourselves and do not identify with those in need, we will cry for help one day and no one will respond.

Because Esther was obedient, the words of David’s psalm came true in the case of Haman: “Look! They have fallen! They have been thrown down, never to rise again” (Psalm 36:12)."
08-20,08-20,232,"Don’t worry about the wicked. Don’t envy those who do wrong. For like grass, they soon fade away. Like springtime flowers, they soon wither. ",Psalm 37:1-2,"In looking back on his long life, David could highlight five attitudes that helped him not to worry, or “fret not,” as the King James Version reads (Psalm 37:1). In common language, we might say “sweat not” because the original word used means “to be under heat or pressure.” When you are walking through a fiery trial, it is imperative that you learn how to “fret” or “sweat” not!

The first thing you’ve got to do is “trust in the Lord” (v. 3), or have an inward confidence that God is going to bring you through to the other side. With a conviction in your heart that God is on your side and wants to do you good, you can face anything.

Second, you must “delight in the Lord” (v. 4), or make the Lord “delicious” to you. Just as a son enjoys his father’s company, so you must enjoy your heavenly Father’s company. Are you truly delighted to spend time with Him, “tasting” of His goodness?

Third, you must “commit everything you do to the Lord” (v. 5), or roll your problem onto Him, acknowledging Him as the only One who can carry your heavy burden. If you commit your problem to Him, you don’t have the option of taking it back! It is too heavy for you; you cannot carry it in your own strength.

Fourth, you must “be still in the presence of the Lord” (v. 7). This implies rest, not continually magnifying Satan’s attack through your speech.

Finally, you must “wait patiently for Him to act” (v. 7), keeping a constant sense of expectation that your miracle is right around the corner. It’s never easy or pleasant to simply wait, but it is the key to seeing God move on your behalf.

Trust, delight, commit, be still, and wait. Your fretting will disappear, and God will bring the victory!"
08-21,08-21,233,The wicked plot against the godly; they snarl at them in defiance. ,Psalm 37:12,"How furious Satan was at Job, a man who was “blameless, a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil” (Job 1:1). Satan continually plotted, planned, and accused Job before God until God finally gave him permission to breach the protective hedge (vv. 10-12).

How could God do such a thing? He had confidence that Job would continue to serve Him, regardless of circumstances, and that Job would prevail over the enemy.

“The wicked plot against the godly . . . but the Lord just laughs, for he sees their day of judgment coming” (Psalm 37:12-13). How can God laugh when we are under such attack by the wicked? The Bible records that God laughs only when someone threatens Him: “Let us break their chains,” they cry, “and free ourselves from this slavery.” But the one who rules in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them”

(Psalm 2:3-4).

God has no problem with confidence, and He also has confidence in you, or He would not allow you to encounter trials. When you laugh at the enemy’s attack, you are simply treating Satan the way God treats him. Pass on through your trial with the laughter of God in your mouth. He is not threatened, and neither should you be!"
08-22,08-22,234,"When you meet, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in an unknown language, while another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must be useful to all and build them up in the Lord. ",1 Corinthians 14:26,"The local church exists for two reasons: the edification of the believer and the evangelization of the unbeliever. All the gifts of the Spirit are intended to edify, or build up, both the person who is releasing the gift and those who are receiving it.

When we go to church, we should be thinking of what God has given us that day that we can share with the other believers. Do we have a song to sing, a testimony to share, money to give, or words of prophecy to speak? If we share our gifts in love, “everyone will learn and be encouraged” (1 Corinthians 14:31). And perhaps even more importantly, unbelievers present with us will be touched in their hearts and say, “God is really here among you” (v. 25).

It is imperative that we, as members of the Body of Christ, understand our gifts and move in them in love. When we release the gifts of the Spirit that are within us, we grow in grace, other believers profit, and unbelievers repent.

Which gift do you bring to your church?"
08-23,08-23,235,"If only there were a mediator who could bring us together, but there is none. ",Job 9:33,"The cry of man throughout the ages has been for someone who could act as an umpire in the game of life. Job envisioned a mediator who could be on equal terms with both God and man and could reconcile us to the Father.

In Christ’s resurrection, Paul presents a picture of the man Job was looking for. “So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, Adam, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man, Christ” (1 Corinthians 15:21). Only a “God-man” could come to earth, die for our sin, and be resurrected as the Son of God.

Jesus, the second Adam, is the Umpire, the One who can stand between God and man to reconcile us. His resurrection has assured us that in the end, He will humble “all his enemies beneath his feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25). Let us look to Jesus as our Hope, both now and forever!"
08-24,08-24,236,"If a tree is cut down, there is hope that it will sprout again and grow new branches. ",Job 14:7,"In an illustration of a tree stump, Job saw a revelation of the resurrection. He envisioned a decaying tree stump with old roots suddenly reviving at the “scent of water” (Job 14:9). Out of the apparent deadness came tender shoots. New life sprang forth from seeming death.

Then Job asked the question of all ages: “If mortals die, can they live again? This thought would give me hope, and through my struggle I would eagerly wait for release” (v. 14). Job received the revelation that in death the physical body simply waits for its renewal to come. In the resurrection day, at the “scent of water,” our dead, lifeless bodies will be quickened by the power of the Holy Spirit and made immortal like Jesus.

Need encouragement? “So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and steady, always enthusiastic about the Lord’s work, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless” (1 Corinthians 15:58). The resurrection is coming!"
08-25,08-25,237,Even now my witness is in heaven. My advocate is there on high. ,Job 16:19,"Through all Job’s struggles, two things brought him hope: there was Someone in heaven who would represent his cause, and even if he died, he would be resurrected. Job longed for an unseen intercessor, who would “mediate between God and me, as a person mediates between friends” (Job 16:21). John tells us that we do indeed have Someone to act as a mediator for us, and “He is Jesus Christ, the one who pleases God completely” (1 John 2:1).

Through all the false accusations leveled by his “friends,” Job clung to one central thought: “I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he will stand upon the earth at last” (Job 19:25). That reality led him to a second conclusion: “And after my body has decayed, yet in my body I will see God” (Job 19:26). This is the clearest statement of Job’s belief in the resurrection. He knew that even after his body was destroyed, he would see God in his own flesh.

Hold to these two great truths for encouragement: Your Advocate is praying for you, and one day, in a glorified body just like His own, you will see Him face-to-face."
08-26,08-26,238,For troubles surround me—too many to count! They pile up so high I can’t see my way out. They are more numerous than the hairs on my head. I have lost all my courage. ,Psalm 40:12,"In his depression, David had obviously reached a point of such despair that he was sure his troubles numbered more than the hairs of his head. Paul was in a similar position in the battles he faced in Asia.

“I think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and completely overwhelmed, and we thought we would never live through it” (2 Corinthians 1:8).

Even in that kind of pressure, Paul found a secret that sustained him. He discovered God as the “source of every mercy and the God who comforts us” (2 Corinthians 1:3). When God comforts us and shows us His mercy, it has a double effect: we learn to rely more on Him, and others learn from our deliverance. We can never totally identify with others until we have walked their paths, and God will use our troubles to become a testimony to others in need.

Lift up your head and let the God of all comfort minister to you right now. Then “many will give thanks” (2 Corinthians 1:11) to God on your behalf, and God will be glorified in it all."
08-27,08-27,239,You have preserved my life because I am innocent; you have brought me into your presence forever. ,Psalm 41:12,"David’s words relate how important it is to know that your conscience is clear when you go through a trial. Satan, the accuser, is quick to send others to question your motives, character, and conduct. But even if all three areas are pure, you still can come under attack from the enemy.

No amount of accusation from Job’s friends could sway his conscience. He declared, “I will never concede that you are right; until I die, I will defend my innocence. I will maintain my innocence without wavering. My conscience is clear for as long as I live” (Job 27:5-6).

Paul, also an object of accusation, wrote to the Corinthian church, “We can say with confidence and a clear conscience that we have been honest and sincere in all our dealings. We have depended on God’s grace, not on our own earthly wisdom. This is how we have acted toward everyone, and especially toward you” (2 Corinthians 1:12).

Of course, neither Job nor David nor Paul was claiming perfection, only godly sincerity of heart. Never let the devil slander your conscience if you have walked in integrity. A weak or wounded conscience will destroy you. Stand up to the accuser, and wait for the vindication of the Lord!"
08-28,08-28,240,"I long for the years gone by when God took care of me, when he lighted the way before me and I walked safely through the darkness. ",Job 29:2-3,"How easy it is in a trial to live life looking through the rearview mirror! Job could not help but remember the times of total peace and prosperity when nothing was wrong and he felt the continual presence of God.

Such rear reflection is destructive, however, because it brings a deep sense of regret and remorse instead of hope for the future. The sons of Korah wrote, “My heart is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the crowds of worshipers, leading a great procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks—it was the sound of a great celebration!” (Psalm 42:4). The effect of such backward gazing is depression. “Why am I discouraged? Why so sad?” (v. 5).

Paul learned to no longer look at the past but to consider the future as one long triumphal procession in Christ (2 Corinthians 2:14). You cannot relive the past—you can only walk with Jesus into the future. Put your past under His blood. Take His hand today and let that relationship give off the aroma of Christ to a watching, waiting world."
08-29,08-29,241,"Blessed are those who are generous, because they feed the poor. ",Proverbs 22:9,"What a comfort it is to know that in our hour of darkness, the Lord will remember those things which we have done in secret for the poor and will reward us openly (Matthew 6:4)!

Job rehearsed his heart for the poor as a statement of his genuine consistency before God. He looked at his servants as his equals because he believed that “God created both me and my servants. He created us both” (Job 31:15). He ministered to the needs of those less fortunate by helping widows and caring for the fatherless (v. 18).

James said, “Pure and lasting religion in the sight of God our Father means that we must care for orphans and widows in their troubles, and refuse to let the world corrupt us” (James 1:27). David observed, “Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor. The Lord rescues them in times of trouble” (Psalm 41:1).

Rather than seeing it as a burden, we must look upon helping someone in need as an opportunity from God to show love. Our concern for the less fortunate may one day be revisited upon us!"
08-30,08-30,242,"We reject all shameful and underhanded methods. We do not try to trick anyone, and we do not distort the word of God. We tell the truth before God, and all who are honest know that. ",2 Corinthians 4:2,"What a powerful witness it is to walk in the light! Paul actually states that a clean, pure walk with the Lord is what helps us to commend ourselves to others. The process is actually very simple. The Holy Spirit shines the light of Christ upon our lives, changing us “from glory to glory” (2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV). That unveiled glory is then reflected from our faces to a darkened, oppressed world whose eyes have been blinded by the “god of this evil world” (4:4).

“For God, who said, ‘Let there be light in the darkness,’ has made us understand that this light is the brightness of the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ” (4:6). From within these “perishable containers” (v. 7) shines out the very glory of the Creator God who spoke a billion suns into existence in one moment!

We are “full of light from the Lord” (Ephesians 5:8), and as we walk in the purity of Jesus’ face, a lost world will behold Him. We walk through pressure, perplexity, and persecution with victory, so that the “life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies” (2 Corinthians 4:10).

Our greatest witness? Our radiant shine!"
08-31,08-31,243,"I said, “Thus far and no farther will you come. Here your proud waves must stop!” ",Job 38:11,"In this verse God patiently explains to Job the limitations He has set for the waves of the sea. Sometimes we think evil has no bounds— that it has free reign to wreak havoc in our lives without any restrictions. However, God Almighty sets the stopping point for the attacks of the devil against us.

In Job’s life God had a predetermined time when He would suddenly throw the whole process into reverse, thus ending the greatest test endured by any human being other than Christ. Job’s patience in trial became the most significant witness of patience in biblical history: “We give great honor to those who endure under suffering. Job is an example of a man who endured patiently. From his experience we see how the Lord’s plan finally ended in good, for he is full of tenderness and mercy” (James 5:11).

The proud waters of evil may be threatening to overwhelm you, but God knows the moment when they will hit their predetermined limit. On that day your enemy will be like a wild dog at the end of a long chain, and you will be able to rest peacefully as God says to the enemy, “This far and no farther!”"
09-01,09-01,244,"Whatever we do, it is because Christ’s love controls us. Since we believe that Christ died for everyone, we also believe that we have all died to the old life we used to live. ",2 Corinthians 5:14,"Want to know why you should be a witness for Jesus Christ? Because He died for all, and therefore, all died. Because you died with Christ, you should no longer live for yourself (2 Corinthians 5:15). Because you no longer live for yourself, you are no longer the same person you were. “What this means is that those who become Christians become new persons. They are not the same anymore, for the old life is gone. A new life has begun” (v. 17)!

God has given you, as a “new creation” believer, the task of reconciling people to Him (v. 18). Your message of reconciliation is this:

“For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people’s sins against them. This is the wonderful message he has given us to tell others” (v. 19). Legally, the world has already been forgiven in Christ; thus, your job is to be His ambassador, imploring people on Christ’s behalf to be reconciled to God (v. 20).

The conclusion? You are dead to your former life and thus unconcerned about public opinion. You live only to inform the lost that Jesus reconciled them to God. Some will receive, some will reject, but all must be told. That, dear ambassador, is your mission!"
09-02,09-02,245,"A river brings joy to the city of our God, the sacred home of the Most High. ",Psalm 46:4,"The psalmist envisioned a beautiful river that flows through the city of God, a place in which God has no enemies and where peace abounds. Right now you may be in the midst of tremendous struggle and difficulty, but inwardly that river can continue to flow. In spite of violent earthquakes, crumbling mountains, or roaring oceans (Psalm

46: 2-3), you can still enjoy perfect peace. “Be silent, and know that I am God! I will be honored by every nation. I will be honored throughout the world” (v. 10).

Paul experienced the continual trouble of the outward man, but he never lost the inward flow of life. He said, “We are well known, but we are treated as unknown. We live close to death, but here we are, still alive. We have been beaten within an inch of our lives. Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything” (2 Corinthians 6:9-10).

Check your “river” today. Has it become choked and clogged by outward pressures, or is it still flowing freely? God lives in the city where the river flows. That city cannot be destroyed (Psalm 46:5), and neither can you if you remain in “the sacred home of the Most High” (v. 4)."
09-03,09-03,246,"A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken. ",Ecclesiastes 4:12,"Unity is a God-given tool that enables us to attain common goals and to encourage one another during difficult times. Solomon saw that two people working together could help each other if one of them fell, grew cold, or was overpowered in an attack (Ecclesiastes 4:10-12). If we are in a spiritual battle, the best thing we can do is to find a prayer partner who will come into instant agreement with us against the enemy’s attack.

The opposite of this beautiful expression of unity is the disunity experienced by Christians who unwisely join with unbelievers. Verses 14-16 of 2 Corinthians emphatically state that there can be no union between Christians and unbelievers. What a tragedy it is to see believers ignore this admonition and lean upon unbelievers in marriage or business! Far too many times, they trip each other up and both fall when encountering moral and spiritual pressure.

Choose your close friends, marriage partner, and business associates carefully, knowing that God ordained your partnerships to be a source of protection, not destruction."
09-04,09-04,247,For God can use sorrow in our lives to help us turn away from sin and seek salvation. We will never regret that kind of sorrow. But sorrow without repentance is the kind that results in death. ,2 Corinthians 7:10,"Godly sorrow for sin is often confused with regret. Tears and remorse are no true indication that a person has truly repented of sin. He may be crying simply because he got caught, not because he is genuinely repentant! The real test of repentance is evidenced by submission, actions that show one has submitted to the authority of another.

After challenging the Corinthian believers to discipline a brother who had fallen into immorality, Paul commended them on their response to his instructions. He said, “Just see what this godly sorrow produced in you! Such earnestness, such concern to clear yourselves, such indignation, such alarm, such longing to see me, such zeal, and such a readiness to punish the wrongdoer. You showed that you have done everything you could to make things right” (2 Corinthians 7:11).

Worldly sorrow is simply regret. It produces blaming others, emotional shows, dodging of facts, half-confessions (“If I’ve done anything wrong . . .”), and insincere promises to change. Godly sorrow, on the other hand, assumes responsibility, faces the facts, admits the wrong, and makes it right.

The Corinthians demonstrated true godly sorrow. They were alarmed over their sin, desirous to right the wrong, eager to address the issue, and ready to make things right. In a word, they submitted themselves to Paul’s authority and were willing to take the necessary steps to right their wrong. Such action, not emotional regret, indicates godly sorrow."
09-05,09-05,248,"Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again. ",Ecclesiastes 11:1 NIV,"Giving is a privilege that God allows us so that we may participate in His blessing. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). When we “so love,” we also will “give.”

Paul challenged the Corinthians to prove the sincerity of their love (2 Corinthians 8:8) with a willingness to give a missionary offering to the poor saints at Jerusalem. By so doing, they literally would be “casting their bread upon the waters,” sending their resources across the Mediterranean to a group of saints in desperate need.

Whenever you purpose to give, the enemy will tell you that you are wasting your money and throwing it away. He will point out to you all your own needs and tell you that you can’t afford to give. In those times, you must remember that God’s Word is true and that whatever you give will one day find its way back to you.

Those you provide for now out of your abundance may one day provide for you out of their abundance (2 Corinthians 8:14). Even if you never see any reward here on earth for your generosity, you will reap in eternity the full return of what you have sown on earth.

The selfish will “die [and] carry nothing with them. Their wealth will not follow them into the grave” (Psalm 49:17). But those who give will reap a sure reward.  Start sowing generously to the needs of others, both here and around the world. The dividends are eternal!"
09-06,09-06,249,"For all the animals of the forest are mine, and I own the cattle on a thousand hills. Every bird of the mountains and all the animals of the field belong to me. ",Psalm 50:10-11,"
It is so important to remember that God does not need our gifts! We must come to look at every penny we possess as already belonging to God and ourselves as being mere stewards. We can never think that the Almighty has need of our possessions as though He had no other resources from which to draw. God can create what He needs! He owns the cattle on a thousand hills, and our offerings neither enrich nor diminish Him.

However, there is a special way that God does need us. He has chosen to use the resources of His people to supply the needs of others. The offering Paul received for the poor saints at Jerusalem was not merely a token gesture, but necessary for their very survival.

We have the awesome privilege as God’s human vessels to supply the needs of His people. Our offerings to others are not needed for God, but are needed by God. He will use our gifts to convince others of our love for them and for Him.

No matter how much or how little we have, God owns all our money. Let’s use it to bring glory to His name while we have the chance!

"
09-07,09-07,250,Remember this—a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop. ,2 Corinthians 9:6,"The power of sacrificial giving is revealed in 2 Corinthians 9:6-11. First, God will measure back to you with the same measuring device you use when giving to Him (v. 6). Second, God is looking for a heart attitude that is free, spontaneous, and cheerful in giving (v. 7). Third, God has the power to resupply your resources to such a point that you will always have enough to give to any worthy project (v. 8). Fourth, God will remember for eternity what you scatter abroad (v. 9). Fifth, if you have a sower’s heart and are faithful, God will give you more and more seed to plant (v. 10). Finally, God will prosper you financially so you can become a resource for building His kingdom in the earth

(v. 11).

How many people fail to start down God’s road of blessing because they sow sparingly? Step through the gate of hilarious, generous, spontaneous giving and watch God supply you with more seed to sow than you ever dreamed possible. He is looking for channels through which He can bless the world!"
09-08,09-08,251,"When people boast about themselves, it doesn’t count for much. But when the Lord commends someone, that’s different! ",2 Corinthians 10:18,"Boasting is verbalized pride. It is self-commendation, bragging to others of our accomplishments. However, all that actually matters is what God thinks of us, not what others think.

Boasting is the exact opposite of the meekness and gentleness of Christ. Paul refused to boast about his personal appearance, power, or accomplishments. Instead, he pointed out that his strength was a hidden force, unnoticed by the world but divinely powerful (2 Corinthians 10:3-4).

Paul used his God-given authority, not for destruction, but for building up (2 Corinthians 10:8). He gave reports about the mission work he had accomplished, not to brag about what he had done, but to show what had been done by the grace of God. Without a doubt, Paul knew that “the person who wishes to boast should boast only of what the Lord has done” (2 Corinthians 10:17).

Isaiah foresaw a day in which “pride will be brought low and the Lord alone will be exalted” (Isaiah 2:11). Satan’s proud, boasting spirit will one day be brought low, and no one will dare utter a boast against the Lord.

“Let him who boasts boast in the Lord” (2 Corinthians 10:17 NIV)."
09-09,09-09,252,"You seem to believe whatever anyone tells you, even if they preach about a different Jesus than the one we preach, or a different Spirit than the one you received, or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed. ",2 Corinthians 11:4,"That is Satan’s motto: “a different Jesus . . . a different Spirit . . . a different gospel”! He disguises himself as “an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14), putting on a religious and holy front while attempting to deceive us.

Paul warned the Corinthians about the subtlety of the one who came to Eve with a slight twist to the commandment of God. Satan tries to take the focus off the cross, the person of Jesus, the reality of sin, the need for repentance, and the certainty of hell. He tries instead to bring us another gospel, one that focuses on man’s goodness, the equality of all religions, the nonessentiality of the blood of Jesus, and the ridiculousness of an eternal hell. All these variations of the Gospel sound good to the natural mind, but Paul recognized them as Satan’s disguise for the true Gospel (2 Corinthians 11:13-15).

Isaiah said, “Destruction is certain for those who say that evil is good and good is evil; that dark is light and light is dark; that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter” (Isaiah 5:20). Satan can call it what he likes, but sin is sin, God is pure, and hell is forever!

Stay simple in your sincere and pure devotion to the real Jesus."
09-10,09-10,253,"Tell him to stop worrying. Tell him he doesn’t need to fear the fierce anger of those two burned-out embers, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah. ",Isaiah 7:4,"King Ahaz learned an important lesson in dealing with an attack of the enemy: you cannot run from the battle! When an army far superior to his own threatened Jerusalem, “the hearts of the king and his people trembled with fear, just as trees shake in a storm” (Isaiah 7:2). But God in His mercy sent the prophet Isaiah to deliver an encouraging message. Through Isaiah God told Ahaz, “This invasion will never happen” (v. 7), and He further instructed the king, saying, “If you want me to protect you, learn to believe what I say” (v. 9).

The enemy’s primary weapon is fear. When disaster loomed on the horizon, Ahaz was overcome by fear, but the bold word from the Lord enabled him to remain calm, relaxed, and confident.

Paul said, “Do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord, no matter what happens. Remember the great reward it brings you!” (Hebrews 10:35). And that reward is a “faith that assures our salvation”

(v. 39).

When the battle seems overwhelming, what choice do you have but to stand firm? If you turn and run from the enemy, you will not stand at all. Burn the retreat bridge! Your only option is to stand—and when you do, God will fight for you!"
09-11,09-11,254,God is with us! ,Isaiah 8:10,"God is with us—these four words strike terror in the heart of our enemies! How it must have disturbed hell the day the Lord proclaimed the sign: “The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel—‘God is with us’ ” (Isaiah 7:14).

When the angel announced to Mary that she would conceive a son (Luke 1:31), he referred to Isaiah’s prophecy of the One who would rule with “fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David” (Isaiah 9:7). This special child, as foretold by Isaiah, would be called

“Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace”

(v. 6). The Messiah’s arrival would mean that “the people who walk in darkness will see a great light—a light that will shine on all who live in the land where death casts its shadow” (v. 2). How perfectly this prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus stepped onto the shores of “Galilee of the Gentiles” (v. 1) and began to undo the works of darkness!

Whatever darkness or trouble you are in today, remember that God came in human flesh, born of a virgin, to signal Satan’s defeat and the reign of God’s kingdom. Immanuel— “God with us”— is here to stay, and He is now living in you!"
09-12,09-12,255,"And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. ",Isaiah 11:2,"Like the six branches of the lampstand in the tabernacle, there are six facets of the Holy Spirit’s character. First, He is the Spirit of wisdom, revealing to us His future purposes both for ourselves and for His kingdom. Second, He is the Spirit of understanding, giving us revelation about our present situation and how best to be fruitful in it. Third, He is the Spirit of counsel, instructing us in solving hard problems by discerning the root causes. Fourth, He is the Spirit of might, strengthening us with power in our inner man and anointing us with His spiritual gifts. Fifth, He is the Spirit of knowledge, revealing to us the various attributes of Jesus in the Word of God. Finally, He is the Spirit of the fear of the Lord, showing us areas of our lives where sin has a foothold and then changing us into the image of Christ.

Jesus, the “stump of David’s family” (Isaiah 11:1), perfectly portrayed all these characteristics. Ask the Holy Spirit to fill you today with these six attributes, and you will walk like Jesus walked!"
09-13,09-13,256,"How you are fallen from heaven, O shining star, son of the morning! You have been thrown down to the earth, you who destroyed the nations of the world. ",Isaiah 14:12,"The prophet Isaiah saw the same picture Jesus described when He said, “I saw Satan falling from heaven as a flash of lightning!” (Luke 10:18). Because of Satan’s pride and arrogance, he was cast out of heaven. He rebelliously and boldly asserted himself with five “I wills”:

“I will ascend to heaven and [I will] set my throne above God’s stars. I will preside on the mountain of the gods far away in the north. I will climb to the highest heavens and [I will] be like the Most High” (Isaiah 14:13-14, bold added).

How unthinkable it is for any creature to consider exalting himself above God! There in the veiled and shadowy reality of eternity past, God judged Satan’s rebellion, and he was thrust like lightning from heaven!

Only what is submitted to God can remain with God. May we never be found with pride, exalting ourselves above God. He alone will be exalted in heaven. “Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens. May your glory shine over all the earth” (Psalm 57:11)."
09-14,09-14,257,"Then David’s throne will be established by love. From that throne a faithful king will reign, one who always does what is just and right. ",Isaiah 16:5,"Just as Satan was cast like lightning out of heaven, he is being cast out of his earthly kingdom by the power of Jesus. As Isaiah says, “The oppressor will come to an end, and destruction will cease; the aggressor will vanish from the land” (Isaiah 16:4 NIV). Isaiah further prophesied that in love a throne would be established, that in faithfulness a man from the house of David would sit on that throne, judging with justice and righteousness (v. 5).

Thank God for the power of love over hatred! “For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son. . . .”(John 3:16). The love of God was manifested to this world the moment Jesus stepped into it. Everywhere He went, the oppressor’s kingdom came to an end. Jesus cast out devils from all those bound by them, “for God was with him” (Acts 10:38). Paul states that Jesus “died for our sins, just as God our Father planned, in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live” (Galatians 1:4).

In your darkest oppression, there is One whom God has sent to rescue you. He is the King on the throne of David. Let Him wrap His arms of love around you and protect, deliver, and rescue you from the oppressor."
09-15,09-15,258,But we refused to listen to them for a single moment. We wanted to preserve the truth of the Good News for you. ,Galatians 2:5,"Paul was determined never to yield to anything opposed to the truth of the Gospel. He wrote to the Ephesians, “Do not give the devil a foothold” (Ephesians 4:27 NIV).

The duty of the Christian parent, pastor, or leader is to “be careful! Watch out for attacks from the Devil, your great enemy. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for some victim to devour” (1 Peter 5:8). Similarly, the Lord warned Isaiah about the need for alertness, saying,

“Put a watchman on the city wall to shout out what he sees. Tell him to sound the alert when he sees chariots drawn by horses and warriors mounted on donkeys and camels” (Isaiah 21:6-7).

Satan seeks to weasel his way into our churches and families through our slack oversight, our tolerance of his encroachment, and our yielding to his advances. Even when the great apostle Peter was being swayed by the hypocrisy of the Judaizers, Paul stood boldly against him, saying, “I had to oppose him publicly, speaking strongly against what he was doing, for it was very wrong” (Galatians 2:11).

The enemy hates your liberty in Christ and does his best to put you back under the “yoke of bondage” (Galatians 5:1 KJV). Don’t give in to anything that is not in the truth of the Gospel. Stand your ground against the devil, and “he will flee from you” (James 4:7)."
09-16,09-16,259,"Furthermore, the Lord, the Lord Almighty, told me to confront Shebna, the palace administrator, and to give him this message: “Who do you think you are, building a beautiful tomb for yourself in the rock?” ",Isaiah 22:15-16,"God is sovereign. He can do whatever He pleases, removing or promoting anyone He desires. He sent Isaiah to warn Shebna, “The Lord is about to seize you and hurl you away. He is going to send you into captivity, you strong man! He will crumble you up into a ball and toss you away into a distant, barren land. . . .”(Isaiah 22:17-18).

Like Haman in Esther’s day, Shebna was a proud, ungodly ruler who felt his power was unlimited. He had no awareness that God would depose him from his office and oust him from his position

“This is the message from the one who is holy and true. He is the one who has the key of David. He opens doors, and no one can shut them; he shuts doors, and no one can open them” (Revelation 3:7).

Submit your life, plans, promotions, and future to the One who holds the keys to life. It is not your strength that can make you great—it is His sovereign power!"
09-17,09-17,260,"From the ends of the earth, I will cry to you for help, for my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the towering rock of safety, for you are my safe refuge, a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me. ",Psalm 61:2-3,"You know you are in trouble when you feel so far away from God’s presence that your address might as well be “the ends of the earth”! David felt the quicksand of doubt, fear, and unbelief underneath his feet. As he grew weaker by the minute, his desperate cry was to be brought to a spiritual position where his feet could feel the Rock of God beneath him.

The moment your heart is safely settled on that Rock, God will keep you in “perfect peace” because your “thoughts are fixed on [Him]” (Isaiah 26:3). Trust is the feeling of security you have when your feet are solidly planted on a Rock that towers high above all your enemies.

That Rock is also a place of safety where you can find secure refuge and shelter (Psalm 61:3-4). As Isaiah phrased it, “But to the poor, O Lord, you are a refuge from the storm. To the needy in distress, you are a shelter from the rain and heat. . ..” (Isaiah 25:4).

Climb up on the Rock right now, and rest in His perfect peace."
09-18,09-18,261,"“Destruction is certain for my rebellious children,” says the Lord. “You make plans that are contrary to my will. You weave a web of plans that are not from my Spirit, thus piling up your sins.” ",Isaiah 30:1,"How easy it is to become entrapped by the natural way of thinking and to craft ways of doing things that completely leave out the Holy Spirit! Egypt looked very enticing to those who were desperate for help, but God told them that trusting in Egypt’s pharaoh for protection would only bring them humiliation and disgrace (Isaiah 30:3). The Holy Spirit has a better plan for you than to take you by way of Egypt!

Following the Spirit carries a price: “And we who are born of the Holy Spirit are persecuted by those who want us to keep the law, just as Isaac, the child of promise, was persecuted by Ishmael, the son of the slave-wife” (Galatians 4:29). It will be the same for you if you refuse the world’s way of thinking. If you don’t solve your problems the “normal way”—the way the world or religion tells you to—you will be persecuted.

God’s ways are not your ways. Before you plow into a crisis armed only with worldly advice, it would profit you to wait on the Holy Spirit for His direction. “I wait quietly before God, for my salvation comes from him” (Psalm 62:1).

Egypt may look tempting, but put your hope in God alone!"
09-19,09-19,262,"The Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says, “Only in returning to me and waiting for me will you be saved. In quietness and confidence is your strength. . . .”",Isaiah 30:15,"Quietness is a state of repose and rest, of no longer struggling and fretting. God wants to give His people quietness, and quietness begins with righteousness. Isaiah 32:17 says, “And this righteousness will bring peace. Quietness and confidence will fill the land forever.”

When we are sure that our sins are forgiven and we are in right standing with God, a deep quietness fills our hearts.

From that quietness arises confidence. We base our confidence on our righteousness, knowing that we are welcome to ask Him for anything we need. We must be confident that “He will respond instantly to the sound of [our] cries” (Isaiah 30:19). John said, “We can be confident that he will listen to us whenever we ask him for anything in line with his will. And if we know he is listening when we make our requests, we can be sure that he will give us what we ask for” (1 John 5:14-15).

Righteousness, quietness, and then confidence will bring us through affliction, for Jesus is like a “cool shadow of a large rock in a hot and weary land” (Isaiah 32:2). Let’s stay in the shadow of His presence!"
09-20,09-20,263,But the people were silent and did not answer because Hezekiah had told them not to speak. ,Isaiah 36:21,"Hezekiah commanded the people on the wall not to answer the taunting insults of the field commander of Sennacherib, king of Assyria. Our flesh, or sinful nature, is always talking to us, trying to convince us to give up and give in to our impulses. For the rest of our lives, we will have to listen to the voice of temptation that is the “opposite from what the Holy Spirit wants” (Galatians 5:17).

The discipline of godliness enables us to refuse to answer that voice, to simply ignore it through the power of the Holy Spirit. The people on the wall were totally submitted to the will of Hezekiah and refused even to acknowledge the field commander. Instead, they continued to think on Hezekiah’s encouraging promise that the Lord would deliver them (Isaiah 36:18).

Which voice in Galatians 5:19-23 will you listen to: the voice of the flesh (immorality, hatred, jealousy, rage, envy, drunkenness) or the voice of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness)? You must learn to completely ignore and turn your back on the flesh, for “the Lord is our judge, our lawgiver, and our king. He will care for us and save us” (Isaiah 33:22)."
09-21,09-21,264,"For you answer our prayers, and to you all people will come. ",Psalm 65:2,"Hezekiah proved the awesome power of prayer through two incidents in his life. First, he faced the terrible army of Sennacherib, who threatened to totally annihilate Jerusalem. In such a desperate moment, Hezekiah merely brought Sennacherib’s threat and “spread it out before the Lord” (Isaiah 37:14). God heard Hezekiah’s intercession and sent the death angel to destroy 185,000 men in one night!

Second, Hezekiah faced impending death because of sickness. Again his response was to pray: “When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord” (Isaiah 38:2). God was so moved by his prayer that He told Hezekiah He would extend his life by fifteen years (v. 5), and to prove His promise would come true, He caused the sun’s shadow to move backward (v. 8).

Oh, how God yearns to answer your prayers, and how able He is to do it! His Word promises, “You faithfully answer our prayers with awesome deeds, O God our savior. You are the hope of everyone on earth, even those who sail on distant seas” (Psalm 65:5).

Be bold enough to ask Him for what you need, even when it looks hopeless. He will literally move heaven and earth to answer your prayer!"
09-22,09-22,265,I pray that you will begin to understand the incredible greatness of his power for us who believe him. ,Ephesians 1:19,"Any power that we possess originates from our awesome God who can hold oceans in the palm of His hand, measure the heavens with his fingers, and weigh the mountains and the hills (Isaiah 40:12). He is a God so powerful that from His perspective the combined nations of the world are a mere “drop in the bucket” (v. 15). He knows the personal name of each and every one of the billions of stars (v. 26), and “no one can measure the depths of his understanding” (v. 28).

All the incomparable greatness of God is embodied in Jesus, and we are blessed with “every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we belong to Christ” (Ephesians 1:3). When we realize His great power, our perspective on our problems changes, and we move into heavenly places where God sits. The problems are not so big when viewed from that vantage point.

God is too wise to make a mistake, too powerful to fail, and too loving to hurt you. Call on Him today, for “He gives power to those who are tired and worn out; he offers strength to the weak” (Isaiah 40:29)."
09-23,09-23,266,Once you were dead. . . . He gave us life. . . . Heraised us from the dead. . . . We are seated with him. . . . ,"Ephesians 2:1, 5-6","“Dead . . . alive . . . raised . . . seated” is the progression of a believer’s position in Christ, according to Ephesians 2. What a glorious revelation to know that we have traveled the entire spectrum from death to being seated with Christ in heavenly places!

You were dead in your sins, and yet God still loved you even though you were His “enemy.” By His grace He made you alive, breathing the same life into your spirit that He breathed into Christ’s dead body in the resurrection. Finally, He lifted you up and seated you in a position so special and honored that it can only be described as the “heavenly places.” According to the passage in Ephesians 2, everything that God did for Christ physically, He has done for you and all believers spiritually!

Your Christian life will be transformed as you understand your identification with Jesus Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension. When God looks at you, He sees you not as you were (dead in sin), but exactly as He sees His Son (alive and seated in the heaven-lies). God loves you exactly as He loves Christ!

You are in Christ in the same way a tiny baby kangaroo is hidden inside the pouch of its mother. So rise up in your new nature and privileges, for “God saved you by his special favor when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God” (Ephesians 2:8)."
09-24,09-24,267,"I am the Lord, who opened a way through the waters, making a dry path through the sea. ",Isaiah 43:16,"Who can forget the fantastic moment when God opened the Red Sea and destroyed Israel’s enemies behind them? What a remarkable day, a miracle unparalleled in human history!

As magnificent as that miracle was, an even greater miracle is the salvation our God freely gives to all. When God gives us new hearts in salvation, we are truly and miraculously reborn. “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing!” (Isaiah 43:18-19 NIV).

Our salvation marks the closing of our past. It is forever gone, buried under the waters of God’s grace. After crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites looked back across the waters and could see nothing of their former captors. The bondage and servitude of the past was wiped out in a moment’s time. It was as though God put up a sign that said, “No fishing allowed!”

Paul said “Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come fearlessly into God’s presence, assured of his glad welcome” (Ephesians 3:12). He not only made a way out from our problems and sin, but He also made a way in to newness of life in Him. Whether you need to come out of something or go in to something today, He is the Waymaker. Wherever He goes, His foes “run for their lives” and “perish in the presence of God” (Psalm 68:1-2)."
09-25,09-25,268,"Listen to me, all you who are left in Israel. I created you and have cared for you since before you were born. ",Isaiah 46:3,"How can we fathom a God who has known us even before our birth? How can we grasp the love of a God who says, “I will be your God throughout your lifetime—until your hair is white with age. I made you, and I will care for you. I will carry you along and save you”

(Isaiah 46:4)?

Cyrus was a great king of the Medes and Persians who was chosen by God to play a pivotal role in the life of the Jewish people. Hundreds of years before his birth, however, Isaiah called him by name and proclaimed a very special prophecy concerning him (Isaiah 45:13). Some traditions say that Daniel read this passage of prophecy to Cyrus, and it so moved him that he released the Jewish people to return home from the Babylonian captivity.

Before we even had enough sense to follow God, the Lord was carrying us and planning lives of destiny for us. He has ordained gifts and callings for us long before we were even born. Paul said that Jesus

“gave these gifts to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers” (Ephesians 4:11). These callings were part of God’s plan for us and His Church from the beginning of time.

Doesn’t it challenge and encourage you to know that God has a plan for your life—a plan that is already known to Him? Your constant prayer should be, “Lord, I beg You to help me lead a life that is worthy of Your calling” (Ephesians 4:1)."
09-26,09-26,269,"Throw off your old evil nature and your former way of life, which is rotten through and through, full of lust and deception. Instead, there must be a spiritual renewal of your thoughts and attitudes. You must display a new nature because you are a new person, created in God’s likeness—righteous, holy, and true. ",Ephesians 4:22-24,"The exciting reality of Christianity is that a believer becomes a new person. In Ephesians 4, Paul contrasts the “old man” and the “new man.” The old man is a liar, while the new man tells the truth (Ephesians 4:25). The old man is always angry, but the new man controls anger and makes amends for it before the day is over (v. 26).

There are further contrasts between the old man and the new. The old man is stingy and steals, but the new man has a desire to work hard and give to others (v. 28). The old man uses abusive language, but the new man speaks words that encourage others (v. 29). The old man holds grudges and bitterness for years, but the new man is kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving (v. 32).

For you to say that you have become a Christian yet continue to lie, vent your wrath, steal, curse, and harbor unforgiveness is a contradiction in terms. As a Christian, you must put off your old self and put on the new self, which was created to be like God. In this way, you will live a life “worthy of your calling” (v. 1) by the grace God has given you through salvation.

Remember: You are a new person!"
09-27,09-27,270,"But instead, they give me poison for food; they offer me sour wine to satisfy my thirst. ",Psalm 69:21,"In certain passages of the Psalms and in the book of Isaiah, two of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament, David and Isaiah, provide a preview of Christ’s crucifixion hundreds of years before it happened. How could even nonbelievers deny the incredible accuracy of their prophecies?

David foresaw the moment when the soldiers would give Jesus gall and vinegar to drink upon the cross after He would say, “I am thirsty” (John 19:28). David also clearly saw and described the crucifixion scene in Psalm 22:16, 18 as he foretold that Jesus’ hands and feet would be pierced and that the soldiers would cast lots for his clothing.

Isaiah, too, foresaw the suffering of Christ upon the cross. He graphically described the disfiguring and marring of Jesus’ countenance (Isaiah 52:14). He also saw that Jesus would be “wounded and crushed for our sins . . . beaten that we might have peace . . . whipped, and we were healed!” (Isaiah 53:5). He saw Jesus “counted among those who were sinners” (two thieves hung on either side of Him) and “put in a rich man’s grave” (vv. 12, 9). Finally, he saw that Jesus “interceded for sinners” (v. 12), fulfilled in Luke 23:34 when He prayed, “Father, forgive these people, because they don’t know what they are doing.”

09-28,09-28,271,". . . No weapon turned against you will succeed. And everyone who tells lies in court will be brought to justice. These benefits are enjoyed by the servants of the Lord; their vindication will come from me. I, the Lord, have spoken! ",Isaiah 54:17,"The kingdom of darkness is a wicked organization of evil that unceasingly plots against the righteous. This kingdom’s carefully crafted snares and weapons are individually tailored to destroy each child of God.

In Ephesians 6, Paul tells us that “we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against those mighty powers of darkness who rule this world, and against wicked spirits in the heavenly realms” (v. 12).

God, however, has provided us with a divine covering to protect us from every attack from the enemy. Commonly called “the armor of God,” this protection listed in Ephesians 6:14-17 includes the following elements: “the sturdy belt of truth and the body armor of God’s righteousness” (v. 14), “for shoes . . . the peace that comes from the Good News” (v. 15), “faith as your shield,” (v. 16), “salvation as your helmet,” and “the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God” (v. 17).

Standing in this mighty armor and wielding the powerful weapon of the Word of God, we have the strength to “pray at all times and on every occasion in the power of the Holy Spirit” (v. 18), positioning ourselves firmly upon the promises of God until the devil flees. No matter what weapon the enemy has forged against you, it will not prosper!"
09-29,09-29,272,"Feed the hungry and help those in trouble. Then your light will shine out from the darkness, and the darkness around you will be as bright as day. ",Isaiah 58:10,"Fasting involves our separating ourselves from food for a season in order to draw close to God on behalf of others. This practice can be easily perverted into a religious activity to be seen of men (as Jesus reminded the Pharisees) or something that is performed while tolerating strife, debate, and self-interest (Isaiah 58:3-4).

Isaiah said that the fast God has chosen is one that focuses on the needs of others. When we become so burdened about a yoke of oppression upon the life of another that we refuse to partake of our normal food until that person is delivered, God is pleased (Isaiah 58:6). For example, Daniel fasted, not for himself, but for the nation to be returned from Babylon (Daniel 9:3).

If we spend ourselves on behalf of the hungry, then God will bless us with light, health, and water (Isaiah 58:8-11). Our light will be a guide through dark places, our health will give physical prosperity and strength, and our water will provide emotional and spiritual joy in times of drought. As someone once said, “Fasting is another way of feasting!”"
09-30,09-30,273,"For I, the Lord, love justice. I hate robbery and wrongdoing. I will faithfully reward my people for their suffering and make an everlasting covenant with them. ",Isaiah 61:8,"Justice protects a person’s equal rights. Whether rich or poor, born or unborn, educated or illiterate, all people are made in the image of God and deserve equal protection and peace.

David prayed for his son Solomon to be endowed with justice (Psalm 72:1). In practical terms, this prayer was asking the Lord to help Solomon “defend the poor, to rescue the children of the needy, and to crush their oppressors” (v. 4). Additionally, David prayed for Solomon to have “pity for the weak and the needy” (v. 13) and to “save them from oppression and from violence” (vv. 13-14).

The secret to obtaining justice is instilling in people a respect for the sanctity of blood, “for the life of any creature is in its blood” (Leviticus 17:11). When we see how precious blood is to God, we will be concerned about its senseless shedding.

The ignorant, foolish man really cares nothing for the blood of another as long as his blood is not being shed! On the other hand, the heart of a man of wisdom is broken by the shedding of innocent blood that offends God and His sense of justice.

Stand up for innocent blood! In that way you are showing you love justice, just as you love the God of justice."
10-01,10-01,274,"And he surely was ill; in fact, he almost died. But God had mercy on him—and also on me, so that I would not have such unbearable sorrow. ",Philippians 2:27,"God is indeed the God of mercy. Paul’s companion, Epaphroditus, almost died for the cause of Christ. He was evidently bringing Paul aid when his overtaxed body became sick to the point of death. At the last possible moment, God mercifully stepped in and spared his life.

The prophet Isaiah spoke eloquently of this merciful God. In speaking of His care for His people Israel, he said, “In all their suffering he also suffered, and he personally rescued them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them. He lifted them up and carried them through all the years”

(Isaiah 63:9). God’s Holy Spirit brought the Israelites out of Egypt, and in their destitution, He fed them, provided for them, and even carried them when they could not walk.

We do our best to walk with God, but sometimes He simply must carry us. At those times when our human flesh is so frail that we feel we cannot go on, God’s mercy takes over. It is our source of strength and comfort in every situation.

Walk if you can, and run if you can. Most of the time your legs and your faith will be strong. But if your strength is gone, jump into His mighty arms of mercy and say, “Father, carry me!”"
10-02,10-02,275,". . . There are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ. Their future is eternal destruction. Their god is their appetite, they brag about shameful things, and all they think about is this life here on earth. ",Philippians 3:18-19,"Is there a real, eternal, burning hell? In Philippians 3:18-21, Paul describes only two options for our final destination: destruction and heaven. How foolish it is for us to make our natural appetites—the temporary pleasures of food, drink, and creature comforts—the altar of our worship! We, as future citizens of the New Jerusalem, are only passing through this world. Paul, well aware of this truth, said this knowledge caused him to “strain to reach the end of the race and receive the prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us up to heaven” (Philippians 3:14). What other goal is worthy of pursuing?

The tragic opposite of the heavenward call is the downward pull of hell. Isaiah said (and Jesus later quoted in Mark 9:48) that for those in hell “the worms that devour them will never die, and the fire that burns them will never go out” (Isaiah 66:24).

Hell is an eternal lake of fire. It is a fixed, immovable torment where death is not an option. Once a person is in hell, it is impossible for him to ever escape. The rich man, suffering the anguish of hell’s flames, begged Lazarus simply to dip his finger in water to cool his parched tongue (Luke 16:24), but it was not possible (v. 26).

Hell is indeed an awful place, but heaven is wonderful beyond measure. I have set my sights on heaven. How about you?"
10-03,10-03,276,". . . You will experience God’s peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus. ",Philippians 4:7,"The peace of God comes from the God of peace. In the fourth chapter of Philippians, Paul tells us how to walk in continual, perfect peace.

First, he pleads with us to reconcile our relationships to others. He addressed a division in the Philippian church, saying, “And now I want to plead with those two women, Euodia and Syntyche. Please, because you belong to the Lord, settle your disagreement” (v. 2). Strained, divisive relationships will always block the peace of God.

Next, Paul says, “Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done”

(v. 6). If you make every concern a matter of prayer, God’s peace will flood your heart and mind, even when your understanding is crying,

Worry!

Finally, Paul challenges us to change our ways of daily meditation. Instead of thinking untrue, immoral, base, corrupt, and ugly thoughts from the enemy, he tells us to “fix [our] thoughts on what is true and honorable and right. Think about things that are pure and lovely and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise” (v. 8). We must fill our minds with thoughts that are consistent with the heaven where we will one day live. Such thoughts will calm our hearts and bring the presence of the God of peace back into our lives. Then the peace of God will be ours until we see the God of peace face-to-face."
10-04,10-04,277,"Christ is the head of the church, which is his body. He is the first of all who will rise from the dead, so he is first in everything. ",Colossians 1:18,"Looking at Colossians 1:13-20, we recognize that Jesus Christ deserves supremacy. In this passage, Paul describes the awesome spiritual dimensions of Christ as God sees Him. Verse 15 speaks of Him as the “visible image of the invisible God.” Then in verse 16, He is described as “the one through whom God created everything in heaven and earth.” He is the actual Creator of anything that has ever been cre-ated—spiritual or physical.

Jesus is the invisible force that binds together even atoms and molecules. Through Him, all things “hold together” (v. 17 NIV). He is the Head of the Body, the Church (v. 18), and He was the first to rise from the dead as a firstfruit of all believers in the resurrection. Verse 19 reveals that all the fullness of God dwells in Him; that is, God’s character, energy, wisdom, and holiness are all contained within Him. Finally, His blood shed on the cross is the means by which fallen humanity is restored to God in peace (v. 20).

Jesus is everything to God, and He should have supremacy in our lives as well. Why should we be fascinated by anyone else? Who else or what else besides Jesus matters? God “has rescued us from the one who rules in the kingdom of darkness, and he has brought us into the Kingdom of his dear Son” (Colossians 1:13)."
10-05,10-05,278,"For it has pleased God to tell his people that the riches and glory of Christ are for you Gentiles, too. For this is the secret: Christ lives in you, and this is your assurance that you will share in his glory. ",Colossians 1:27,"The mystery of all ages is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Just as we see Christ in all His glory, we also see how Christ in us is our hope of glory.

Paul’s challenge was to impart Christ into the lives of the believers. He wanted every person to be perfect, or mature, in Christ (Colossians 1:28). Maturity in Christ comes, first of all, from receiving correction when necessary. We need someone around us who will warn us of danger zones, blind spots, and areas that block the glory of Christ in our lives.

Second, spiritual maturity comes from being taught. How desperately we Christians need instruction in engaging in spiritual warfare, raising our families, managing our finances, receiving guidance, developing the fruit of the Spirit, and learning about a host of other subjects relevant to godliness. Someone once said, “We need more information and not just more inspiration.”

Third, perfection, or maturity, comes when believers are “knit together by strong ties of love” (Colossians 2:2). Love is the highest attribute of perfection, and Christ in us desires to reach out to others in love.

If we follow these three guidelines—receiving correction, being taught, and walking in love—we will “have complete understanding of God’s secret plan, which is Christ himself” (v. 2)."
10-06,10-06,279,"So now the Lord says, “Stop right where you are! Look for the old, godly way, and walk in it. Travel its path, and you will find rest for your souls. But you reply, ‘No, that’s not the road we want!’ ” ",Jeremiah 6:16,"The “old, godly way” is the path where we will find rest for our souls. This place is described in the New International Version of the Bible as the “ancient paths” and is called the “good way.” Israel’s journey through the wilderness as chronicled in Psalm 78 describes the path on which the people of God were instructed to walk.

First, the path was one of deliverance: “He divided the sea before them and led them through” (Psalm 78:13). The Lord knows how to deliver His people from all their enemies, even if the path leads in an unorthodox way!

Second, the path was one of guidance: “In the daytime he led them by a cloud, and at night by a pillar of fire” (v. 14). Because the Lord’s path is always better than our own, we should ask Him to show us where the “cloud” is moving in our lives.

Finally, the path was one of provision: “He split open the rocks in the wilderness to give them plenty of water, as from a gushing spring” (v. 15). If we keep walking in the paths of the Lord, there will be constant provision. We must remember the words of Psalm 23:1: “The Lord is my shepherd; I have everything I need.”

With the promise of God’s deliverance, guidance, and provision, why would we ever say of the path of the Lord, “No, that’s not the road we want!” (Jeremiah 6:16)? Choose to walk in the godly way, and find rest for your soul."
10-07,10-07,280,"This is what the Lord says: “Let not the wise man gloat in his wisdom, or the mighty man in his might, or the rich man in his riches.” ",Jeremiah 9:23,"Wisdom, strength, and riches are the three goals that the world passionately pursues. Anyone who achieves status in one of these three areas is celebrated as someone great by those in the world. Such pursuit, however, leads to three main areas of sin: intellectual pride, lustful passion, and greed.

Jeremiah warned that a wise man shouldn’t boast of his wisdom any more than a strong man should boast of his strength or a rich man of his wealth. Why? Because those wise, strong, and rich men produced none of those characteristics in their lives. It was God alone who gave them whatever wisdom, strength, or riches they possess.

Paul reminded the Colossians, “For you died when Christ died, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3). We must put to death the proud mind of man that flatters and exalts himself in his own eyes. We must crucify the sinful desires of the flesh, such as “sexual sin, impurity, lust, and shameful desires” (v. 5). Furthermore, we cannot “be greedy for the good things of this life, for that is idolatry”

(v. 5).

If we boast of anything in this world, it should only be the awesome fact that we understand and know the Lord personally. In everything else, let us put on humility, purity, and generosity. The world may not appreciate us when we do, but in God’s eyes we will be pursuing true wisdom, strength, and riches!"
10-08,10-08,281,Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and a thankful heart. ,Colossians 4:2,"Prayer is our occupation. It is not meant to be a halfhearted, wishful endeavor, but rather it should be wholehearted, intense, fervent, and devoted. What a privilege it is for us to engage in the one thing that will change everything!

Epaphras was a mighty prayer warrior who wrestled in prayer for the Colossians (Colossians 4:12 NIV). The word wrestle means “to agonize,” or “to wrestle as in a wrestling match.” In Epaphras’s day, wrestling was the most intense athletic match in the Olympics, and for Paul to describe Epaphras’s prayer as “wrestling” shows the intensity with which this brother labored in prayer.

Epaphras’s fervent prayer was that the Colossians might be “strong and perfect, fully confident of the whole will of God” (v. 12). Satan is continually opposing the will of God in our lives, and only through wrestling, agonizing prayer can the will of God be accomplished. Epaphras was willing to agonize over the Colossian church.

God told the prophet Jeremiah, “Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, for I will not listen to them when they cry out to me in distress” (Jeremiah 11:14). We may wrestle in prayer on behalf of others, but they bear the responsibility of responding to God’s overtures. What a tragedy it is when people resist God so much that He will no longer hear prayer on their behalf!

Let us wrestle, watch, and agonize in prayer daily. Our families and friends are depending upon us."
10-09,10-09,282,". . . If racing against mere men makes you tired, how will you race against horses? If you stumble and fall on open ground, what will you do in the thickets near the Jordan? ",Jeremiah 12:5,"Can you race on foot against horsemen? Jeremiah asks a pointed question about our level of commitment. The obvious implication is that if we grow tired and give up when dealing with relatively inconsequential problems, we will never be able to handle major problems. If we have problems dealing with grocery money, how will we be able to manage Kingdom finances? If we cannot keep our own house in order, how will we rule nations?

Sometimes we twenty-first-century Christians feel as though we have it rough. The early Church, however, had it much rougher. They were indeed running with the horsemen! Paul commended the Thessalonians’ faith and perseverance, saying, “You received the message with joy from the Holy Spirit in spite of the severe suffering it brought you” (1 Thessalonians 1:6).

The presence of greater challenges in our lives doesn’t mean that God has left us, but it does mean He trusts our ability to run with the horses. With the help of God, you can outrun any challenge in your life, as Elijah did when he outran Ahab’s horses all the way to Jezreel (1 Kings 18:46).

Get ready for a new level of commitment. The foot race is over— the horses are coming!"
10-10,10-10,283,"Remove the dross from the silver, and the sterling will be ready for the silversmith. ",Proverbs 25:4,"Silver must be purified seven times before it is perfectly pure. Dross and impurities lie hidden within the silver, and only heat can drive them out.

God knows that our imperfections, too, can only be removed by heat. Paul prayed that none of the Thessalonians would be unsettled by such trials. He told them, “But, of course, you know that such troubles are going to happen to us Christians” (1 Thessalonians 3:3).

Satan, our eternal enemy, seeks to stop us (1 Thessalonians 2:18) and tempt us (3:5) in an effort to steal our faith. But our faith is like the silver being refined. It is that precious thing that keeps us close to God during a trial and keeps us moving forward when Satan is trying to drive us backward.

Timothy’s return and good report led Paul to say, “We have been greatly comforted, dear brothers and sisters, in all of our own crushing troubles and suffering, because you have remained strong in your faith” (1 Thessalonians 3:7). Every trial you encounter and walk through successfully only purifies your faith and refines it to a higher quality.

Stay in the fire, Christian. God knows that one day you will be “strong, blameless and holy when you stand before God our Father on that day when our Lord Jesus comes with all those who belong to him” (v. 13)."
10-11,10-11,284,"But blessed are those who trust in the Lord and have made the Lord their hope and confidence. They are like trees planted along a riverbank, with roots that reach deep into the water. . . . ",Jeremiah 17:7-8,"Cursed is the one who trusts in man, but blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord. These are lifetime statements that give a broad overview of the difference between two directions in life.

The first statement depicts people who continually look to others to solve their problems. Getting help from others is not wrong, but the Lord says, “Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans and turn their hearts away from the Lord. They are like stunted shrubs in the desert, with no hope for the future. They will live in the barren wilderness, on the salty flats where no one lives” (Jeremiah 17:5). To such people, trusting in God and His Word is foolishness. They feel their best option in any circumstance is to follow the way of the world.

The second statement describes those who trust in the Lord. In every circumstance, they know they are planted beside a continual stream of refreshment under which their roots lie. Though drought, famine, and heat may sear everything around them, their roots draw strength from the unchangeable nature of God. People expect them to wither, dry up, and crack, but those who trust in the Lord remain ever green and fruitful through all circumstances.

Trust God. He will “subdue [your] enemies” and “feed you with the best of foods” (Psalm 81:14, 16)!"
10-12,10-12,285,"Do not stifle the Holy Spirit. Do not scoff at prophecies, but test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good. Keep away from every kind of evil. ",1 Thessalonians 5:19-22,"How easy it is for us to hear a word from the Lord and decide that it does not apply to our lives or that it is not for today!

Pashhur, the priest in charge of the temple of the Lord, despised Jeremiah’s prophecies against the detestable practice of sacrificing children to Baal in the valley of Topheth (Jeremiah 20:1-2). This horrible ritual took place with the heathen priests of Baal beating drums to drown out the screams of little babies being burned alive. Jeremiah said that performing such atrocities never entered God’s mind (19:5).

Humankind can stoop to some terrible deeds when there is no voice of reason. Jeremiah saw this dreadful scene of infant sacrifice and prophesied the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem. When Pashhur threatened him, Jeremiah said, “I can’t stop! If I say I’ll never mention the Lord or speak in his name, his word burns in my heart like a fire. It’s like a fire in my bones! I am weary of holding it in!” (20:9).

We should not despise prophecy, but invite it. We should pray for God to give us voices in our nation to proclaim the truth before it is too late. The lives we save may be our own."
10-13,10-13,286,"“For the time is coming,” says the Lord, “when I will place a righteous Branch on King David’s throne. He will be a King who rules with wisdom. He will do what is just and right throughout the land. And this is his name: ‘The Lord Is Our Righteousness.’ In that day Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety.” ",Jeremiah 23:5-6,"The prophet Jeremiah could foresee Jesus’ first coming. Though he lived hundreds of years before Christ’s birth, Jeremiah saw by the Spirit of God that One was coming from the line of David who would blaze a trail that would ultimately touch every person in history. He would restore total justice and wisdom to a sin-gripped land. Jeremiah saw a time when Judah would be saved, and Israel would live in safety. Most importantly, he saw the name of the One who would accomplish this: The Lord Is Our Righteousness. What name could better describe Jesus?

Paul saw ahead in time to the second coming of Jesus. He saw the Lord coming back from heaven “with his mighty angels, in flaming fire” (2 Thessalonians 1:7-8). Like Jeremiah, he saw ahead to the time when Jesus will set everything right on earth again—a time when He will eternally punish the wicked and they will be “forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power” (v. 9).

When Jesus returns, He will assume all the glory on earth and be worshiped by both the Church and the Jewish converts. “In that day Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety” (Jeremiah 23:6).

Get ready and stay ready, for The Lord Our Righteousness is on His way. He’s coming for you!"
10-14,10-14,287,For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness is revealed—the one who brings destruction. ,2 Thessalonians 2:3,"Just as Christ is returning to the earth, the Antichrist is also coming. Paul reminded the Thessalonians of several facts regarding the mysterious person he referred to as the “man of lawlessness.”

First, Paul said, “He will exalt himself and defy every god there is and tear down every object of adoration and worship. He will position himself in the temple of God, claiming that he himself is God” (2 Thessalonians 2:4). His spirit will be that of a proud, boastful, arrogant beast.

Second, Paul pointed out that the Antichrist could not be revealed yet because something was holding him back (v. 6). Many believe that this “something” is the Church, inhabited by the Holy Spirit. When the Church is removed, however, the Antichrist will manifest.

Finally, Paul said that incredible signs and wonders that will deceive all humankind will accompany Antichrist’s coming (vv. 9-10). The people who refuse the simple truth of the Christ will be deceived by Antichrist’s lies, and they will eternally perish.

So stand firm, believer. You may pass through the “Valley of Weeping” (Psalm 84:6), but you will dwell in the house of the Lord forever!"
10-15,10-15,288,"I listen carefully to what God the Lord is saying, for he speaks peace to his people, his faithful ones. But let them not return to their foolish ways. ",Psalm 85:8,"The source of our peace is our right standing with God. When we get out of sorts with God’s purpose and will, peace departs. The psalmist, understanding this relationship between righteousness and peace, declared, “Unfailing love and truth have met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed!” (Psalm 85:10).

Paul prayed that “the Lord of peace himself always give you his peace no matter what happens” (2 Thessalonians 3:16). Our actions determine our peace. We should spend our lives, therefore, in productive, focused labor.

The Bible clearly states that “whoever does not work should not eat”

(v. 10). To be “busy,” but not “busybodies,” means that we know our jobs, vocations, and callings and are working hard every day to accomplish them. Many people chase idle dreams and foolish talk but never produce anything. Consequently, they grow frustrated and lose their peace. If we will work hard and “never get tired of doing good” (2 Thessalonians 3:13), however, then the Lord of peace will give us peace.

Have you lost your peace? Find your work, and you will find your peace."
10-16,10-16,289,"Therefore, the Lord says you must die. Your life will end this very year because you have rebelled against the Lord. ",Jeremiah 28:16,"These sobering words were delivered to a false prophet named Hananiah, who had prophesied that the Jewish people would be restored from Babylon within two years. This prophecy contradicted Jeremiah’s clear teaching that they would be captives in Babylon for seventy years, not two.

Satan has always had his prophets who look right and sound right. They are like Hymenaeus and Alexander, who shipwrecked their own faith by teaching that the resurrection was past (1 Timothy 1:19-20).

False doctrine works its way into churches as well as into individuals. It misleads and steers away from faith and a good conscience. All true teaching will produce “love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and sincere faith” (v. 5).

Judge all teaching. The teaching may look good and sound right, but does it lead to godly actions? Does it lead people away from “talking foolishness” (v. 6) and cause them to focus on saving sinners?

Keep your doctrinal ship steered down the center of the channel. Beware of the shorelines, no matter how appealing. The rocks of destruction lurk just beneath the surface!"
10-17,10-17,290,"Pray this way for kings and all others who are in authority, so that we can live in peace and quietness, in godliness and dignity. ",1 Timothy 2:2,"Prayer is the foundation of a godly society. Paul admonished us to offer prayers for kings and all those in authority. When we pray for our rulers, they become softened to the purposes of God, respectful to the Church, and honest and just in their lawmaking.

A peaceful and quiet society is the best environment in which the lost may be saved. When Satan is influencing government, wicked laws are passed, anarchy rules, and the Church is persecuted. Preaching the Word, printing Bibles, and establishing churches are forbidden in that environment.

God our Savior “wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth” (1 Timothy 2: 4). He sent His Son as a ransom for all men and women (v. 6), and thus He desires nations to be open to the preaching of the Gospel. Whenever we come together with other believers, we should pray specifically for each nation and ruler “with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy” (v. 8).

A praying church, an open government, a perfect sacrifice, and an obedient preacher will bring the Gospel to the ends of the earth and usher in Jesus’ return to reap the harvest!"
10-18,10-18,291,"“But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day,” says the Lord. “I will put my laws in their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.” ",Jeremiah 31:33,"God can do a new thing! He told Jeremiah that He would make a new covenant in the future that would far surpass the old one. Today we are living under that new covenant. God has put His law in our minds and written it on our hearts. He has forgiven our wickedness and will remember our sins no more (Jeremiah 31:34).

At a time when the nation of Israel was being invaded, God directed Jeremiah to buy a piece of property. Jeremiah purchased the land, placed the deed in a jar, and buried it. The Lord promised that once again Israel would return to the land, and the deed would then be worth something. Jeremiah responded to the Lord and to this incredible promise by saying, “Nothing is too hard for you!” (Jeremiah 32:17). God agreed with this assessment, saying, “I am the Lord, the God of all the peoples of the world. Is anything too hard for me?” (v. 27).

Have you lost all hope? God can and will do the impossible. If He can forgive your sins forever, He can fix your problems right now. Place your confidence in His strong covenant. Absolutely nothing is too difficult for God!"
10-19,10-19,292,"The Lord said, “I have made a solemn agreement with David, my chosen servant. I have sworn this oath to him: ‘I will establish your descendants as kings forever; they will sit on your throne from now until eternity.’ ” ",Psalm 89:3-4,"When God makes a covenant, He means eternal business. In biblical times, a covenant was sealed between two parties by their cutting an animal in half and walking between the pieces in a figure-eight movement. Israel had entered into that kind of covenant with God, yet failed to keep it. God was forced to respond with these words:

“Because you have refused the terms of our covenant, I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize your vows” (Jeremiah 34:18).

It is human nature to make and then break covenants. God, however, cannot break a covenant. He promised Jeremiah that if he could break God’s “covenant with the day and the night so that they do not come on their usual schedule, only then will my covenant with David, my servant, be broken. Only then will he no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne” (Jeremiah 33:20-21). The chances of David not having an heir as king on Israel’s throne are less than the chances of the sun not shining anymore! That’s how faithful God is!

With a God who is that unchangeable and faithful, we must also be true to Him—the faithful God who keeps His covenant forever."
10-20,10-20,293,"Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah: “The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and say to the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Come and learn a lesson about how to obey me.’ ” ",Jeremiah 35:12-13,"Jehonadab, son of Recab, was quite a man. He was an upstanding man of iron principle who taught his children and grandchildren the precepts of righteousness. His biblical career started when he joined Jehu in destroying the prophets of Baal (2 Kings 10:15-17). Jehu saw in Jehonadab a man who would not compromise with Jezebel and her wicked prophets, but would follow through in delivering judgment against them.

Jehonadab commanded his children and grandchildren to live by certain standards and principles, and these principles were still being upheld centuries later during Jeremiah’s day. In Jeremiah 35:5-6, Jeremiah offered Jehonadab’s family huge bowls full of wine, which they refused. They strictly maintained the principles of purity they had received from their ancestor many years before. Jeremiah used the family of Jehonadab as a perfect example of a family who consistently put principles ahead of personal choice.

It’s easy to change your convictions because they don’t feel good. King Josiah just took a knife and cut out the parts of the Bible he did-n’t like (Jeremiah 36:23)! Don’t change your Bible to fit your lifestyle— change your lifestyle to fit your Bible. In the end, you’ll be glad you did!"
10-21,10-21,294,"For the love of money is at the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows. ",1 Timothy 6:10,"Paul taught Timothy three vital truths about finances. First, he taught him that the love of money can be dangerous to one’s spiritual health. Money itself is not evil, but the love of money is a dangerous deception that can lead even to being drawn away from the faith. The proper attitude toward money must be one of contentment. As we live our lives, we must be thankful for what we have, not always wanting what we don’t have.

The second truth is that God desires to bless us. He “richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment” (1 Timothy 6:17). God is not a taker— He’s a giver! He longs to bless us for our enjoyment.

The third truth Paul shared regarding money is the principle of giving. He urged Timothy to instruct the rich to remember to use their earthly wealth for doing good, thus laying up an eternal reward in heaven (vv. 18-19).

The finances we invest in others and in God’s work will be multiplied back to us in the life to come. Let’s use our money as a tool for eternal investment, and one day we will see it again."
10-22,10-22,295,"For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline. ",2 Timothy 1:7,"Fear can oppress and mask wonderful talents. In his youth, Timothy was naturally timid and fearful. He thus tended to hide his gifts for fear of rejection. Paul exhorted him “to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you” (2 Timothy 1:6).

God gave you unique gifts and talents to use in His service, and “you must never be ashamed to tell others about our Lord” (2 Timothy 1:8). Fear causes those special gifts to lie smoldering inside you, smothered by intimidation and dying for lack of encouragement. When you begin to pray in the Holy Spirit, however, the latent gifts within you begin to burn brightly and become visible.

The Holy Spirit’s power came upon Timothy through the laying on of hands, a method used throughout the Bible to impart blessing and release giftings. This was also the way Moses imparted the spirit of wisdom to Joshua (Deuteronomy 34:9).

David refused to let fear control and smother his life. Instead, he stated, “Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night, nor fear the dangers of the day” (Psalm 91:5).

Rise up, stir up, and speak up. Release your gifts, and be not ashamed!"
10-23,10-23,296,You have heard me teach many things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses. Teach these great truths to trustworthy people who are able to pass them on to others. ,2 Timothy 2:2,"Long-term success is achieved only if there is a successor. Paul knew this and thus instructed Timothy to impart everything he had learned from him to other reliable people. In 2 Timothy 2, Paul used three images of a reliable, faithful person.

First, he said a faithful person is like a soldier (2:3), who will endure hardship as part of his calling. Good soldiers do not get involved in things that distract them from following their commanders; no matter what, they maintain their focus. In order to be faithful to Jesus, our total focus must be on fighting the battle of faith with Him, not on gaining worldly position.

The second image of a faithful Christian is that of an athlete (2:5). An athlete must follow all the rules if he wants to win the game. To break the rules means instant disqualification. The image of the athlete reflects the need for character in the life of the Christian. Only those who live pure lives within the constraints of God’s commands will win the prize.

The last image of a faithful Christian is that of a farmer (2:6). Diligent, hardworking farmers are models of patience. The seeds they sow into the soil must gradually grow into crops. If the farmer wants to reap a harvest, he cannot become impatient and dig up the seed to see if it is growing yet! Similarly, we must be patient with our growth and that of others in the Lord. Patiently we must wait for the harvest of spiritual growth.

If you find a focused, pure, patient servant of the Lord, invest your time in that person. One day he will do the same for someone else, and your life will have counted for something great."
10-24,10-24,297,"Happy are those whom you discipline, Lord, and those whom you teach from your law. ",Psalm 94:12,"Although the word discipline may create a negative connotation in our minds, it is actually quite a positive principle. In our flesh, we are content to do as we please, say what we want, and live how we feel. Discipline, however, gets our flesh in order. It is like putting a train on its track. The train has far more freedom on the track than it would have if it were trying to be free off the track!

How it offends us to be in public with someone whose child is totally unruly and undisciplined! It is an embarrassment to the family and to the child. Conversely, when children know their places, their boundaries, and their limitations, they experience real freedom and security. Disciplined children are a blessing both to themselves and everybody else.

God, as our Father, wants to train us. He is willing to confront us and help us change areas of our lives that bring shame upon the Kingdom of God. Because of His concern and love for us, He says, “But I must discipline you; I cannot let you go unpunished” (Jeremiah 46:28).

Discipline is a blessing! Put yourself in the hands of the Lord, and remember that His discipline is not rejection, but genuine acceptance."
10-25,10-25,298,But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don’t be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at bringing others to Christ. Complete the ministry God has given you. ,2 Timothy 4:5,"Do you feel called into ministry? In 2 Timothy 4:5, Paul outlined four sequential steps that should occur for entering the ministry. It is important information for anyone who is called to minister.

First, he said to “keep a clear mind in every situation.” Learning to observe carefully what is going on around you will begin your ministry training. Watch and learn from seasoned pastors, missionaries, and teachers to see how they minister.

Second, Paul said, “Don’t be afraid of suffering for the Lord.” After a season of watching and being under the care of your ministry mentor, you will enter a season of flying solo. Your flight may be rough at first, but all of us have to encounter a little hardship in order to test our mettle!

The third stage of entering ministry is to do the work of an evangelist, “bringing others to Christ.” Every minister should be a soul winner. Timothy was a pastor, not an evangelist, but Paul told him to throw himself into personal evangelism anyway.

Finally, Paul said to “complete the ministry God has given you.” The day will come when you will put on your ministry like a custom-fitted jacket. The preparation will be over, the ministry will fit you, and you will enjoy your calling for the rest of your life!"
10-26,10-26,299,"You who love the Lord, hate evil! He protects the lives of his godly people and rescues them from the power of the wicked. ",Psalm 97:10,"Paul challenged those who love the Lord not to be “arrogant or quick-tempered . . . a heavy drinker, violent, or greedy for money” (Titus 1:7). He expected those who loved God to live exemplary lives.

The challenge of controlling evil emotions, appetites, and greed is not an easy one. To serve in the position of an elder, a person “must enjoy having guests in his home and must love all that is good. He must live wisely and be fair. He must live a devout and disciplined life” (v. 8). The lives and characters of godly people must show that they hate evil and are committed to doing everything within their conscious power to remove it from their lives.

The opposite of such a person is the one who tolerates evil. “For there are many who rebel against right teaching; they engage in useless talk and deceive people” (v. 10). These types of people teach wrong doctrine, love money, lie, and turn others away from the truth (vv. 11-13). They so tolerate evil that “their minds and consciences are defiled”

(v. 15).

These two kinds of people represent two different paths in life. If you intend to see God one day, remember that “righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne” (Psalm 97:2). Follow the upward path, for God “protects the lives of his godly people and rescues them from the power of the wicked” (v. 10)."
10-27,10-27,300,"“For the time is surely coming when I will punish this great city and all her idols. Her whole land will be disgraced, and her dead will lie in the streets. The heavens and earth will rejoice, for out of the north will come destroying armies against Babylon,” says the Lord. ",Jeremiah 51:47-48,"Babylon was destined to fall. Even though Babylon’s final demise was years in the future, Jeremiah could see through his prophetic eye that the time for Babylon’s fall had come (Jeremiah 51:13).

God had used Babylon to destroy Jerusalem, and for many years the Babylonians ruled over the Jews to the glory of their false god. Now the time had arrived for the Medes to be stirred up to attack the seemingly invincible city of Babylon. History records that the Medes diverted the Euphrates River, which ran through the city of Babylon, and were able to penetrate the massive city walls in one night. When God gets ready to judge a proud nation, the curtain of history has closed for them!

John the Revelator foretold the same collapse for the future economic empire called Babylon: “How terrible, how terrible for Babylon, that great city! In one single moment God’s judgment came on her”

(Revelation 18:10).

It doesn’t matter how great, lofty, and mighty the world’s empires are—they will all fall before Jehovah God. His awesome power is described this way: “The Lord is king! Let the nations tremble! He sits on his throne between the cherubim. Let the whole earth quake!” (Psalm 99:1). We, too, should tremble, remembering what happened to the great Babylon."
10-28,10-28,301,"Remind your people to submit to the government and its officers. They should be obedient, always ready to do what is good. ",Titus 3:1,"Even before we become Christians, many of us think we are “good.” The Word of God, however, clearly states the contrary. At one time, all of us “were foolish and disobedient. We were misled by others and became slaves to many wicked desires and evil pleasures. Our lives were full of evil and envy. We hated others, and they hated us” (Titus 3:3).

In His kindness and love, God saved us, washed us in His blood, and renewed us in the Holy Spirit. His goodness to us made us good. Now, because of that goodness living in us, we devote our lives to doing what is good (v. 8).

Doing good includes submitting to those in authority, and living an obedient, gentle, humble, and peaceable life (v. 2). As we follow these guidelines, we will live productive lives, devoting ourselves to providing for daily necessities and the needs of others

(v. 14).

The central theme of the Psalms is the goodness of the Lord. Psalm 100:5 puts it this way: “For the Lord is good. His unfailing love continues forever, and his faithfulness continues to each generation.”

Let us enjoy His goodness today and rejoice that He has changed us into someone “good.” God is good all the time, and so should we be!"
10-29,10-29,302,I will refuse to look at anything vile and vulgar.... I will reject perverse ideas and stay away from every evil. ,Psalm 101:3-4,"What we look at shapes our lives. David said he would not set before his eyes any vile thing. In this world we live in, our minds are bombarded daily with vile and vulgar images. From television, magazines, movies, and even the daily lives of others comes the constant portrayal of the perverse, proud, deceptive, profane, and slanderous.

What can we do about it? We can do as David did and be totally intolerant of filth. Whenever something from the enemy came before David’s eyes, he immediately cast it from his mind. We cannot afford to meditate passively on unclean and worthless things that our minds conceive. Rather, we must follow Paul’s instructions to “take captive every thought” (2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV) and David’s admonishment to “stay away from every evil” (Psalm 101:4).

Analyze your environment. Conduct spiritual housecleaning, if necessary, and do not let evil enter your presence (Psalm 101:7). Your mind will clear, temptation will lift, and you will dwell in safety."
10-30,10-30,303,"The unfailing love of the Lord never ends! By his mercies we have been kept from complete destruction. Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each day. I say to myself, “The Lord is my inheritance; therefore, I will hope in him!” ",Lamentations 3:22-24,"Isn’t it easy during times of weariness and bitterness to forget the Lord’s faithfulness? But Jeremiah, in his most desperate time, remembered that God’s compassion never fails. Because “He doesn’t enjoy hurting people or causing them sorrow” (Lamentations 3:33), we are assured that no matter what trial we are walking through, God still loves us and is not the cause of our problems. Whether a “clear” day or a “cloudy” day dawns, His mercies truly “begin afresh each day” (v. 23). Great is His faithfulness!

Our job in the midst of difficulty is to stop being so restless and fitful. We must learn “to wait quietly for salvation from the Lord” (v. 26), never doubting that He loves us and will deliver us.

Both David and Paul understood the faithfulness and mercy inherent to the Lord’s nature. In Psalm 102:27, David said, “But you are always the same; your years never end.” In Hebrews 1:12, Paul expressed the same thought: “But you are always the same; you will never grow old.” Everything around us may change—even the world itself—but God never changes.

Are you feeling bitter toward God? Hang on, and remember that He will always be there to hang on to you. The “appointed time has come” (Psalm 102:13 NIV) for your miracle!"
10-31,10-31,304,"Praise the Lord, I tell myself; with my whole heart, I will praise his holy name. Praise the Lord, I tell myself, and never forget the good things he does for me. ",Psalm 103:1-2,"Rejoice in your spiritual benefits! According to Psalm 103, your benefit package includes five specific blessings.

First and most importantly, God forgives all your sins. Nothing is more valuable than having your sins removed from you, “as far as the east is from the west” (v. 12).

Second, He heals all your diseases (v. 3). The root of disease sprang from the cesspool of sin in the Garden of Eden. But if the root is cut, the fruit (the disease) is also rendered powerless!

Third, He ransoms, or redeems, you from death (v. 4). Satan’s power over your life is broken, for just as God redeemed Israel from the hand of Egypt, so Jesus redeemed you with the shedding of His blood.

Fourth, He surrounds (“crowns” in the New International Version) you with “love and tender mercies” (v. 4). The Holy Spirit has come to rest upon your head like the anointing oil rested upon, or crowned, the Old Testament high priest. That presence will surround you with God’s mercy every day of your life.

Fifth, your life will be filled with “good things” (v. 5) and your strength renewed. Your temporal and physical needs will all be supplied from God’s abundance.

These are your benefits: forgiveness, healing, deliverance, anointing, and provision. Rise up today and claim your inheritance!"
11-01,11-01,305,"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me. (May the glory of the Lord be praised in his place!) ",Ezekiel 3:12,"The glory of God is awesome. Ezekiel saw the massive living creatures moving at the speed of light on wheels full of eyes. Fire, wind, and lightning swirled around the creatures, while above them was the throne of God sitting on a crystal floor. What a glorious sight! Psalm 104:3 also describes God’s awesome glory: “You make the clouds your chariots; you ride upon the wings of the wind.”

We can contrast God’s glorious nature to the rebellious nature of humankind. God called the Israelites a “hard-hearted and stubborn people” (Ezekiel 2:4). When the Israelites were in the wilderness they rebelled against Moses, even though they could see the literal cloud and fire above them day and night.

Humanity should melt like wax before the awesome glory of God Almighty, but instead, people harden their hearts and rebel. The message of the Holy Spirit is “Today you must listen to his voice. Don’t harden your hearts against him as Israel did when they rebelled, when they tested God’s patience in the wilderness” (Hebrews 3:7-8). Soften your heart today and listen to His voice, for one day you will see His glory face-to-face!"
11-02,11-02,306,So there is a special rest still waiting for the people of God. ,Hebrews 4:9,"Hebrews 4 reveals that rest is a precious commodity, stemming first from a promise (v. 1). God’s promises can give us rest and soothe our minds when we are troubled. After we receive the promise, however, we must combine it with faith (v. 2). Faith is the “fuel” in our “engine” that brings the promise to life. A promise without faith has no power, in the same way that an engine without fuel has no active energy.

We know that our faith is activating a promise when the result is rest. “For only we who believe can enter his place of rest” (v. 3). The moment our faith mixes with a promise, a perfect rest enters our hearts. All anxiety, frustration, fear, and worry depart, and God’s rest is ours.

God is not anxious about problems! When we believe His Word, we enter into His rest.  Therefore, when we are troubled we must bring a promise to God’s throne, mix it with faith, and sit quietly in the rest of God until He performs it.

“Let us do our best to enter that place of rest” (Hebrews 4:11)!"
11-03,11-03,307,"Then I heard the Lord say to the other men, “Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity! . . . Begin your task right here at the Temple.” ",Ezekiel 9:5-6,"God always starts His process of purifying in His own house. In the New Testament, Peter echoed that thought, saying that judgment must “begin first among God’s own children” (1 Peter 4:17). What a sober realization that judgment begins first among God’s people!

Ezekiel 9 speaks of a man dressed in linen who was carrying a writer’s case. The man was instructed to walk through the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the forehead of every person who had wept and sighed because of the sins they saw taking place around them (v. 4). Apparently, there were those who grieved deeply for the sins of their society.

The average person today has no concern for the gross immorality and debauchery existing in our society. Such an individual thinks homosexuality is “gay,” abortion is “necessary,” and drunkenness and adultery are “acceptable.” For God’s saints, however, these things should be repulsive and deeply grievous.

God marked Noah as righteous in his generation and spared only his family from the flood that enveloped the earth. Even now God is “marking the foreheads” of those whose lives are pure and who closely follow His commands.

Remember: This process begins in the sanctuary, so check your “mark” today."
11-04,11-04,308,. . . Follow the example of those who are going to inherit God’s promises because of their faith and patience. ,Hebrews 6:12,"Faith and patience are two wings of the same bird. You may not always experience instant results from your faith; in fact, more often than not, you must wait for the results. But with consistent faith and patience, you can obtain the results you need.

Abraham is a prime example of patient waiting. “Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised” (Hebrews 6:15). First he had to wait, and then he received the promise. In the same way, it should not really matter to us when the Lord performs His Word. His timetable is perfect, and He is never late. What should matter is that we learn to relax in His promise and hold on to our confidence, which is like a “strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls” (v. 19).

Joseph’s life also illustrates the successful blend of faith with patience. The dreams and visions of his childhood seemed to be hidden forever as he languished in an Egyptian prison. The Word of God records, “There in prison, they bruised his feet with fetters and placed his neck in an iron collar. Until the time came to fulfill his word, the Lord tested Joseph’s character” (Psalm 105:18-19).

You must understand that the Word of God is testing your faith until it has passed the true test of its worth. Faith is patience in waiting on the promises. Therefore, time must pass to prove that your faith is patient.

Be encouraged today. Your patience for the promise will produce!"
11-05,11-05,309,"But he brought his people safely out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold; there were no sick or feeble people among them. ",Psalm 105:37,"Think of the transition from rags to riches! The Israelites had lived in squalor and filth, yet suddenly they were draped in the gold, silver, and jewelry of the world’s richest nation.

God has a plan of financial blessing for His people. The blood of Jesus paid the price for our deliverance from the land of bondage. Consequently, we can expect our inheritance of provision. That provision begins with the giving of the tithe (Hebrews 7:2). Just as Abraham gave the tithe, or one-tenth, of the spoils of battle to Melchizedek, we give our tithes to the One who “lives on” (v. 8).

God always had His priests collect the tithe. Because we no longer have an earthly priesthood, Jesus, the great High Priest, is collecting the tithe. We give our tithes to the local church, referred to as the storehouse in Malachi 3:10, and Jesus receives them. Then, like Israel of old, we come under the covenant of God’s blessing.

Can God bless in any circumstance? Israel received an abundance of quail, manna, and water in the desert (Psalm 105:40-41). Can’t He meet our needs as well, if we are obedient with our tithes?"
11-06,11-06,310,An open rebuke is better than hidden love! Wounds from a friend are better than many kisses from an enemy. ,Proverbs 27:5-6,"How do you react when someone corrects you? Are you threatened and defensive, or do you receive correction with a grateful heart?

God always “tells it like it is” to His people. He reminded Israel that she had at one time been like an infant cast out of doors, bloody and naked. His faithful concern for her brought her to maturity, adulthood, and prominence. Rejecting God’s faithfulness, however, Israel became faithless and was described in Ezekiel 16:32 as an “adulterous wife who takes in strangers instead of her own husband.” So corrupt was Israel that God compared her to a prostitute that insisted on paying her suitors (vv. 33-34)! These rebukes, harsh though they may seem, were intended to bring Israel back to repentance.

Those who whitewash sin and do not tell you the truth about yourself are actually contributing to your destruction. It is better to be rebuked openly if it causes your repentance and restoration. Look for friends who are willing to wound you with correction, rather than enemies who multiply kisses!

A friend’s courage in confronting you will produce a change in your character and may save you from eternal destruction. After all, doesn’t everyone have a blind side?"
11-07,11-07,311,"Sodom’s sins were pride, laziness, and gluttony, while the poor and needy suffered outside her door. ",Ezekiel 16:49,"Three basic factors contribute to the destruction of a society, and Sodom had them all! Sodom was destroyed because its citizens were proud, lazy, and gluttonous.

When a people become proud, their intellects excuse them from standards of basic decency. The Sodomites grew so proud and arrogant that they thought they could leave the natural order of sexuality and engage in homosexuality. God, however, viewed their perverted ways as “loathsome” (Ezekiel 16:50).

In addition to being proud, the people of Sodom were lazy and unconcerned about others. Being so self-centered, they had little to do with their time. People who are bored and unconcerned about others gradually begin to live for pleasure.

Finally, the inhabitants of Sodom were overfed gluttons. They had so much bread and food that their entire lifestyle revolved around eating and pleasure. Though, of course, we need food, it is never to be the focus of our lives. As Christians, we should “eat to live,” not “live to eat”!

How can we guard against these three deadly diseases of society? We must continually humble ourselves in prayer before God. We must then work for the Kingdom of God, showing concern for and compassion to others and not just living for pleasure. We must regularly fast to remind ourselves that man shall not live by bread alone.

Prayer, godly work, and fasting are the “salt” that will preserve against the rot of condemned societies of the past."
11-08,11-08,312,"However, if righteous people turn to sinful ways and start acting like other sinners, should they be allowed to live? No, of course not! All their previous goodness will be forgotten, and they will die for their sins. ",Ezekiel 18:24,"Ezekiel reminds us that it is not the way people start in their walks with God, but the way they finish, that counts. When a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin, the righteous things he has done are no longer remembered.

Sitting back and resting on our spiritual laurels is a dangerous posture. How often have people served the Lord for perhaps a year, five years, ten years, or longer . . . and then, toward the end of their lives, thrown it all away?

Moses spent forty years in the wilderness being faithful in God’s house (Numbers 12:7). However, at the very end of the journey, he lost his composure in front of all Israel. “Rash words came from Moses’ lips” and “trouble came to Moses because of them” (Psalm 106:33, 32 NIV).

On the other hand, if there are people who spend their lives in wickedness but repent in the end, “All their past sins will be forgotten, and they will live because of the righteous things they have done” (Ezekiel 18:22).

Don’t be self-satisfied, thinking you cannot fall, and don’t condemn yourself, believing you cannot rise. Remain in an attitude of repentance, and you will make it to the end. “Put all your rebellion behind you, and get for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O people of Israel? I don’t want you to die, says the Sovereign Lord. Turn back and live!” (Ezekiel 18:31-32)."
11-09,11-09,313,Has the Lord redeemed you? Then speak out! Tell others he has saved you from your enemies. ,Psalm 107:2,"In Psalm 107, the psalmist lists four areas from which we are redeemed and for which we should praise the Lord. The first group of the redeemed were those who were wandering around the wilderness with nothing to eat (vv. 4-5). But when they cried to the Lord, He “rescued them from their distress” (v. 6). As our Provider, the Lord satisfies our hunger and thirst, both spiritually and physically. Praise the Lord for His provision!

The second group of the redeemed were those who were in emotional or physical bondage (v. 10). But when they called on the Lord, He “led them from the darkness and deepest gloom; he snapped their chains” (v. 14). He is our Deliverer, the One who can set us free from darkness, gloom, and depression and break our chains of bondage. Praise the Lord for His deliverance!

The third group were those who were so physically sick and diseased that they could no longer eat (vv. 17-18). They, too, cried to the Lord, and “He spoke and they were healed—snatched from the door of death” (v. 20). The Lord is our Healer, victorious over any affliction that attacks our bodies. Praise Him for His healing!

The last group included people who were confused by hopeless circumstances (vv. 23-27). When they cried out, “He calmed the storm to a whisper and stilled the waves” (v. 29). The Lord is our Light in the darkest storms of life. Praise Him for His guidance!

Are you hungry, bound, sick, or confused? The Lord is your Redeemer, and He wants you to praise Him!"
11-10,11-10,314,"I looked for someone who might rebuild the wall of righteousness that guards the land. I searched for someone to stand in the gap in the wall so I wouldn’t have to destroy the land, but I found no one. ",Ezekiel 22:30,"
This verse contains both a promise and a penalty. The encouraging part of the scripture is that God is looking for just one person who will be righteous and pray fervently for his nation. We sometimes wait for crowds and multitudes to join us in prayer, but God is looking for even one individual who will intercede for his country.

That one person must see himself as mediating a large gap between a holy God and a sinful nation destined for His judgment. What an important position! Because Moses willingly stood in such a gap, the nation of Israel was spared.

The sad reality of the situation in Ezekiel was that even though God needed only one person, He could not find a single one. Today may you and I be such an intercessor, knowing our rights in the new covenant of grace.

Always remember: You may be that person upon whom God is focused—the one who is holding back His wrath. Keep praying, for God is surely watching!

"
11-11,11-11,315,So let us stop going over the basics of Christianity again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start all over again with the importance of turning away from evil deeds and placing our faith in God. ,Hebrews 6:1,"Deliberate sin brings dreadful punishment. Think of the beautiful things of God that sin tramples. First, deliberate sin “trampled on the Son of God” (Hebrews 10:29). The corporate sin and individual sins of all mankind were responsible for putting Jesus on the cross. Imagine punishing Christ all over again with your own hands and then simply walking over His precious body. Paul stated that when we commit willful sin, we are in effect “nailing the Son of God to the cross again by rejecting him, holding him up to public shame” (Hebrews 6:6).

Second, those who engage in willful sin have “treated the blood of the covenant as if it were common and unholy. Such people have insulted and enraged the Holy Spirit who brings God’s mercy to his people” (Hebrews 10:29). Jesus’ blood is the purest, most holy thing in the universe, and it has sealed an eternal pact with God. To deliberately sin is to act as if that blood were worthless.

Finally, deliberate sin insults the Spirit of grace. The Holy Spirit is so precious, forgiving, and long-suffering. To deliberately sin against the Lord is to offend, insult, and take advantage of the Spirit’s goodness. Judas acted in this way, and his judgment and that of others like him is recorded in Psalm 109:1-20.

Run from sin, not just for your own sake, but also because of the horrible shame and pain it will cause the God who gave His life in your place."
11-12,11-12,316,What is faith? It is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen. It is the evidence of things we cannot yet see. ,Hebrews 11:1,"Can we be sure of something we cannot see? The certainty of faith goes beyond hope. Hope has to do with the future, our eternal reward once this life is over. In contrast, faith has to do with the present. The King James Version of Hebrews 11:1 begins with the phrase “Now faith.” If it’s not now, it’s not faith!

The entire concept of faith rests on being certain of the unseen, because all creation came into existence from things that are not seen (Hebrews 11:3). The fact that something is unseen does not make it unreal. God’s Word operates in the unseen realm, and faith in His Word is what brings those things into the seen realm.

It takes evidence, a piece of objective data in which you place your full confidence, to be certain of something you cannot see. The promises of the Bible must become your evidence and certainty even when your five senses see no tangible reality in the natural world.

Fix your attention on God’s promises until your hope graduates to become faith!"
11-13,11-13,317,"You were in Eden, the garden of God. Your clothing was adorned with every precious stone—red carnelian, chrysolite, white moonstone, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald—all beautifully crafted for you and set in the finest gold. They were given to you on the day you were created. ",Ezekiel 28:13,"Ezekiel describes in a prophetic picture the beauty and perfection of Satan in the Garden of Eden. Leading the worship of God, Satan was clothed with garments decorated with beautiful stones, and some believe he was even covered in musical instruments. He was a “mighty angelic guardian” (Ezekiel 28:14), walking among the fiery stones that surround the throne of God.

Satan’s high position and beauty led him to imagine himself as the source of that beauty and position. Jesus said that He saw “Satan falling from heaven as a flash of lightning!” (Luke 10:18). And how great was that fall! He lost everything he could lose and was thrown to the earth, exposed to “the curious gaze of kings” (Ezekiel 28:17).

We must always remember the wisdom of showing reverence to the Lord. To Him alone belongs eternal praise (Psalm 111:10). It may sound like a simple lesson—to walk humbly in the fear of the Lord— but it is the one the devil never learned. To have the fear of the Lord means we always reverence Him as first and never take any praise for ourselves. If we will give God the glory, one day the Church will occupy the position Satan forfeited so long ago."
11-14,11-14,318,. . . Those who are righteous will be long remembered. ,Psalm 112:6,"People come and go and are remembered for various contributions to society. However, the “huge crowd of witnesses” spoken of in Hebrews 12:1 are remembered for their mighty faith.

Think of the rich heritage recorded in the Scriptures of faith-filled believers. They were great men and women of character, endurance, vision, and accomplishment who “overthrew kingdoms, ruled with justice . . . shut the mouths of lions, quenched the flames of fire, and escaped death by the edge of the sword. . . .” (Hebrews 11:33-34).

Some were raised from the dead, and others chose death over betraying God, desiring a better resurrection (v. 35). They were unafraid of the saw, the sword, or the shame. They were willing to live in caves, mountains, and deserts and to clothe themselves in sheepskin or goatskin. Their powerful testimonies inspire us all.

Of course, the greatest Hero of faith is Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. His one, solitary life exemplifies a life of the greatest courage in adversity. “He was willing to die a shameful death on the cross because of the joy he knew would be his afterward” (Hebrews 12:2).

Follow Jesus. Live for Him, and die for Him—and you also will be remembered forever."
11-15,11-15,319,"When God spoke from Mount Sinai his voice shook the earth, but now he makes another promise: “Once again I will shake not only the earth but the heavens also.” ",Hebrews 12:26,"No more awesome sight has ever occurred in history than when Mount Sinai began to shake and tremble under the power of God. Paul records, “Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said, ‘I am terrified and trembling’ ” (Hebrews 12:21). The entire mountain was covered with “flaming fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind” (v. 18). In addition, all the people “heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice with a message so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking” (v. 19). This frightening demonstration of sound effects and raw power made even the bravest soul tremble and was intended to bring the Israelites to an unforgettable sense of reverence and godly fear.

Paul said, “Let us be thankful and please God by worshiping him with holy fear and awe. For our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:28-29). In worship, we do not approach a physical mountain, but we come to the eternal mountain of God: Zion, “the heavenly Jerusalem”

(v. 22).

One day we will stand before God Himself, the One who moves mountains. In the meantime, let us heed the words of the psalmist:

“Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Israel” (Psalm 114:7)."
11-16,11-16,320,"But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn’t sound the alarm to warn the people, he is responsible for their deaths. They will die in their sins, but I will hold the watchman accountable. ",Ezekiel 33:6,"Leadership is an awesome responsibility. To stand before others as a leader implies two great responsibilities. First, Ezekiel said that a leader is a watchman (Ezekiel 33:2). The watchman’s job is to stand upon the wall and never relax his vigilance in looking for the enemy. The watchman is no respecter of persons, but he issues the warning for all to hear. If the watchman is sleeping, afraid, or unconcerned about giving the warning, the Lord will hold him accountable for the blood of his people.

The leader’s second responsibility is as a shepherd (Ezekiel 34:2). The leader is not only to lead but also to feed the flock of God. The leader who spends all his time and attention feeding himself neglects his flock. Ezekiel rebuked such leaders, saying, “You have not taken care of the weak. You have not tended the sick or bound up the broken bones. You have not gone looking for those who have wandered away and are lost. Instead, you have ruled them with force and cruelty” (v. 4). Shepherds should never be harsh, brutal, or uncaring, but rather they should serve as examples of kindness and concern to their flocks.

Leaders who fulfill the dual roles of watchman and shepherd should be highly respected. “Obey your spiritual leaders and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls, and they know they are accountable to God. Give them reason to do this joyfully and not with sorrow. That would certainly not be for your benefit” (Hebrews 13:17).

Obey and pray for your watchman and shepherd, for your spiritual life is in his hands."
11-17,11-17,321,God blesses people who patiently endure testing. Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. ,James 1:12,"Are you going through a severe trial today? If so, your mind must settle certain issues. First, your reaction to the trial should be one of joy, for the testing of your faith develops perseverance (James 1:2-3). Rejoice when trials come your way, because without a test, there can be no testimony.

Second, you should remember that if you persevere and withstand the test, you will receive the crown of life (v. 12). All your earthly difficulties are simply adding jewels to your eternal crown and reward. That is a life-changing way to look at trials, now isn’t it?

Finally, you should never blame God for all your trials. He does not tempt you to sin and only gives you what is good. “Whatever is good and perfect comes to us from God above, who created all heaven’s lights” (v. 17). Always remember “how kind the Lord is! How good he is! So merciful, this God of ours!” (Psalm 116:5).

The summary of the matter? Trials are working in your character, they are temporary, and God is concerned about your trials. One day you will be on the other side of the trial, saying to yourself as the psalmist said, “Now I can rest again, for the Lord has been so good to me” (Psalm 116:7)."
11-18,11-18,322,"The Lord took hold of me, and I was carried away by the Spirit of the Lord to a valley filled with bones. He led me around among the old, dry bones that covered the valley floor. They were scattered everywhere across the ground. ",Ezekiel 37:1-2,"Ezekiel saw a massive valley of dry bones. What a picture of today’s Church—disconnected, dry, divided, and dead! The once-powerful army of the early Church has disintegrated into a fractured, feeble graveyard of spiritual relics.

Now must come the breath and life of God! Someone once said, “God does not breathe on anything that is not connected.” As believers in the Church of Jesus Christ, we must come back into relationship with one another, crossing racial, denominational, and even national lines of boundary. In Ezekiel, the connecting together of the dry bones brought muscle, tendons, breath, and balance back to the body. Then the revived body stood upright, a great army filled with the Spirit of God (Ezekiel 37:10).

How easy it is for the Church to become disconnected by economic status, race, or educational level. James corrected the believers who were favoring the rich over the poor in their congregational seating arrangements (James 2:3). The “royal law” tells us to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 19:19); thus, the Church must provide for the daily physical and emotional needs of others. There can be no favoritism in extending the love of Christ to one group of people over another.

You cannot live disconnected from the rest of the Body of Christ. Look around, hook up, get involved, and feel the precious breath of God invigorating and empowering you!"
11-19,11-19,323,Wisdom has built her spacious house with seven pillars. ,Proverbs 9:1,"James describes these seven pillars of wisdom (James 3:17) and contrasts them to the wisdom that is “earthly, unspiritual, and motivated by the Devil” (v. 15). First, wisdom is pure. Living a mixed, compromised lifestyle may appear smart, but it is not wise.

Second, wisdom is peace-loving. This attitude is in direct contrast to the world’s envy and selfish ambition, which results in “disorder and every kind of evil” (v. 16).

Third, wisdom is gentle. A wise person practices gentle courtesy and always considers the needs, desires, and feelings of others.

Fourth, wisdom is submissive. A person’s willingness to yield his will to the overall good of the family, community, or local church is a mark of true wisdom.

Fifth, wisdom is full of mercy and good fruit. A wise person will demonstrate obvious marks of goodness, charity, and forgiveness toward those who have injured him.

Sixth, wisdom is impartial, never valuing the face or status of someone instead of that person’s actual deed or need.

Finally, wisdom is sincere. A wise person is not hypocritical, but possesses a deep, inward authenticity. With him, what you see is what you get!

Establish your life on these seven pillars, and you will “plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of goodness” (v. 18)."
11-20,11-20,324,"Open for me the gates where the righteous enter, and I will go in and thank the Lord. ",Psalm 118:19,"Drawing close to the Lord should be your lifetime pursuit. Sometimes, however, that process is hindered. James writes about two stages you may have to pass through as you attempt to enter God’s presence.

First, James says to “humble yourselves before God” (James 4:7). Pride, lust, and friendship with the world will block your prayer requests. Also, you may be asking with wrong motives: “You want only what will give you pleasure” (v. 3). However, if you humble yourself and submit your life to God, then your requests will be made from right motivations.

Next, James says to “resist the Devil, and he will flee from you”

(v. 7). Satan may be hindering your requests from coming to pass, even though God has granted them. When Daniel prayed, his prayer was actually answered from the first day, but Satan hindered it from coming to pass for twenty-one days (Daniel 10:12-13).

After you humble yourself and resist the devil, you will be able to “draw close to God, and God will draw close to you” (James 4:8). God loves you and is waiting for you to draw near through the gate of the Lord!"
11-21,11-21,325,"And their prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make them well. And anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven. ",James 5:15,"Prayer is the mightiest force upon earth. It is powerful enough to help the troubled, the sick, or the sinner (James 5:13-16).

Elijah is an example of one of the most powerful “pray-ers” in the Bible. He was subject to the same human frailties that we experience when we pray: boredom, fatigue, discouragement, hunger, and thirst. However, so powerful a prayer warrior was he that when he prayed for no rain, “none fell for the next three and a half years!” (James 5:17).

Elijah was consistent for more than three years in holding back the rain through prayer. Then, during a seven-part prayer drama on Mount Carmel, he sent his servant to look for a cloud of rain over the Mediterranean. Six times the servant returned discouraged. Finally, Elijah’s prayer broke through, and the cloud of rain soaked the parched soil.

Our prayer goal? More than anything else, we must pray for those who have strayed from the truth of the Gospel and work to bring them back to right relationship with God (vv. 19-20).

Pray on, fervent Christian. The cloud of salvation is beginning to rise!"
11-22,11-22,326,They must wear linen turbans and linen undergarments. They must not wear anything that would cause them to perspire. ,Ezekiel 44:18,"Serving the Lord is to be “no sweat”! God would not allow His servants who came before Him and ministered to Him to be in a sweating, fretful state of mind or body. We often think that serving God should tax our bodies, strain our relationships, bankrupt our finances, and cost us our sleep. Instead, Jesus said, “My yoke fits perfectly, and the burden I give you is light” (Matthew 11:30).

Peter said that we are to be joyful, even though we may have to go through many trials (1 Peter 1:6). Can you imagine rejoicing when you feel like weeping? Peter continued by telling us that we can be “happy with a glorious, inexpressible joy” (v. 8), even in the midst of a trial.

The psalmist expounds the third note in the heavenly chord of today’s reading: “If you will help me, I will run to follow your commands” (Psalm 119:32). Run? “Only children run,” you may say. Not so! Rejoice in God and run to Him with your worries and cares. The Christian life, though it can be difficult, should be “no sweat”!"
11-23,11-23,327,"For you have been born again. Your new life did not come from your earthly parents because the life they gave you will end in death. But this new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living word of God. ",1 Peter 1:23,"A Christian’s appetite for the Word of God must be as voracious as a newborn baby’s craving for milk. A baby’s mouth snaps and its head jerks around the moment it senses nourishment is near. Similarly, baby birds open their mouths wide when their mothers return to the nest with food. The young of all species have an insatiable craving for food.

God’s Word is imperishable seed, the living and enduring Word of God. Nothing in this world will last, “but the word of the Lord will last forever” (1 Peter 1:25). God’s eternal Word is the diet of the human spirit. It changes us, enabling us to rid ourselves of “all malicious behavior and deceit” (2:1).

Peter’s admonition is that like newborn babies, we are to crave spiritual milk so we may grow up in our salvation (2:2). A baby drinking from a bottle is cute, but an adult drinking from a bottle is definitely not cute! We’ve got to grow up in Christ. David said, “How I delight in your commands! How I love them!” (Psalm 119:47). Love for God and His commands will cause us to hunger for the Word of God that will mature us.

Make God’s Word your staple. Crave it, love it, and feed on it. You will find yourself growing into a new person!"
11-24,11-24,328,There I could see the stream flowing out through the south side of the east gateway. . . . At that point thewater was up to my ankles. . . . This time the water wasup to my knees. . . . It was up to my waist. . . . The riverwas too deep to cross without swimming. ,Ezekiel 47:2-5,"
Ezekiel saw a vision of a river flowing eastward from the threshold of the temple. The river measured varying depths, and we can use this analogy to examine the level of our relationship with God.

First, we may be splashing around in the shallow, “ankle-deep” water with God. Our goal may be just to follow the crowd and have a good time as long as it lasts!

Hopefully, we decide to venture farther into the river and move into the “knee-deep” water. This gets us involved in the local church through regular attendance, prayer, and fellowship.

Third, we may dare to wade deeper into the river. The “waistdeep” water involves areas such as commitment, Bible study, personal prayer, and discipline of character.

The last area is water that is deep enough to swim in. We now come to the area of leadership and fulfilling life’s calling. This is the area of faith—the area where we are in water “over our heads” and totally dependent upon God.

Some may be satisfied to simply splash around in the river of God, but you will never be truly satisfied until you fulfill your purpose. Dive in! The water is fine!

"
11-25,11-25,329,"Now, who will want to harm you if you are eager to do good? ",1 Peter 3:13,"Daniel and his friends were men of integrity. Captured by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Daniel and three others from Judah’s royal family were ordered to live in the king’s palace for a three-year training period. Early on they resolved not to defile themselves with the royal food and wine offered by the king’s servants (Daniel 1:8). Everything about these young men testified of the good, wholesome will of God in their lives. Then came the time for their testing.

Satan did everything he could to destroy them and their influence with the king. It seemed as though their doom was sealed until Daniel spoke to the captain of the guard with “wisdom and discretion” (2:14). His wise words won him and his friends a stay of execution. Later that night the Lord revealed the king’s disturbing dream to Daniel. As a result, instead of being harmed, Daniel and his friends were promoted!

When you come under persecution, be certain you are pursuing God’s good will with all your heart. He will give you the favor you need with whoever is responsible. “The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right, and his ears are open to their prayers. But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil” (1 Peter 3:12)."
11-26,11-26,330,"Dear friends, don’t be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through, as if something strange were happening to you. ",1 Peter 4:12,"Peter said we shouldn’t be surprised or afraid at the painful things that happen in our lives. One way or another, we will all come face to face with a “trial by fire,” a moment in our lives when we decide if serving God is worth losing everything.

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego walked through a fiery trial. The three young Hebrew men reached a quality decision before the king: “If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. . . . But even if he doesn’t, Your Majesty can be sure that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up”

(Daniel 3:17-18). The courageous young men had determined that whether the trial burned them or they burned the trial, they were going to serve God!

Once you have decided that you are going to withstand any trial and realize that “these trials will make you partners with Christ in his suffering” (1 Peter 4:13), nothing Satan throws at you can affect you. In fact, you will find that Jesus is there in the fire with you (Daniel 3:25). The only things you will lose in the fire are your chains, for they will be burned off!"
11-27,11-27,331,"But leave the stump and the roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze and surrounded by tender grass. Now let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live like an animal among the plants of the fields. ",Daniel 4:15,"The stump in this dream typified King Nebuchadnezzar. His pride had brought him to the point of his becoming obnoxious to God. Indeed, he ruled the entire known world and lived in the most magnificent city in the world. His construction of the hanging gardens of Babylon is still considered one of the eight wonders of the world. However, the time came when God had to humble him.

Nebuchadnezzar may have been king, but God is “Chairman” of the “Ways and Means Committee”! He is in charge, and “he is able to humble those who are proud” (Daniel 4:37). God removed Nebuchadnezzar’s intellect and made him eat grass like a cow for seven years. In His mercy, however, He did not totally destroy him, but left him as a stump, restoring everything to him the moment the trial was over.

You may feel like you have lost everything, but in fact, your stump is still intact. God may have disciplined you, but He still loves you. And when God restores you, it will be with “even greater honor than before” (v. 36).

Cheer up, all you “stumps.” The best is yet to be!"
11-28,11-28,332,I tremble in fear of you; I fear your judgments. ,Psalm 119:120,"When the fingers of a human hand wrote on the plaster of the wall, King Belshazzar’s face “turned pale with fear. Such terror gripped him that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way beneath him”

(Daniel 5:5-6). Even the bravest sinner is terrified before the pure revelation of God’s justice.

How often people mock God as though He were some senile puppy hiding under the porch! Their ignorance only displays their lack of understanding of His long-suffering. Someone once said, “Never mistake the long-suffering of God for His approval.” Those who persist in wrongdoing, counting on God’s mercy to overlook their sins, will one day be forced to account for their actions. “Their destruction is their reward for the harm they have done” (1 Peter 2:13).

When Belshazzar touched the holy vessels of the temple of God (Daniel 5:3-4), he crossed the line with God. He met the same fate as did the rebellious angels, the people of Noah’s day, and Sodom and Gomorrah. Belshazzar pushed the mercy of God over the line, and God’s mercy turned to judgment.

Walk before God in fear and trembling, for He is an awesome God."
11-29,11-29,333,"Then the other administrators and princes began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling his affairs, but they couldn’t find anything to criticize. He was faithful and honest and always responsible. ",Daniel 6:4,"Daniel’s final instance of supernatural deliverance is perhaps the most instructive. In everything he did, Daniel was above reproach. He was trustworthy, incorruptible, and honest. His lifestyle, decisions, moral standards, honesty, and work ethic were unmatched.

When extreme persecution came into Daniel’s life, it was because of his righteousness, not because of some fault in the way he conducted his life. This purity became his confidence in the time of trouble. In the dark night of the lion’s den, the angel of the Lord was with Daniel. “My God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths so that they would not hurt me, for I have been found innocent in his sight” (Daniel 6:22).

Your integrity is your shield. Peter said, “Make every effort to live a pure and blameless life. And be at peace with God” (2 Peter 3:14). If you will work on the “pure and blameless” part, God will work on the “delivering” part!

When the enemy seems to have the upper hand, search your heart. If it is innocent and pure before God, you can proclaim with the psalmist, “Those lawless people are coming near to attack me; they live far from your law. But you are near, O Lord, and all your commands are true” (Psalm 119:150-151)."
11-30,11-30,334,"Then in my vision that night, I saw a fourth beast, terrifying, dreadful, and very strong. It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth and trampled what was left beneath its feet. It was different from any of the other beasts, and it had ten horns. ",Daniel 7:7,"
There were four major world kingdoms in the ancient world: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. Daniel saw each of these kingdoms in animal form. The last kingdom, the Roman Empire, was an empire that was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.

In world history, Rome ceased to exist as an empire centuries ago. However, in biblical prophecy, from this last empire will arise a world ruler spoken of as the “little horn,” or Antichrist. The Roman Empire is still around in seed form, and during the close of time, it will revive again as a league of ten nations.

The Antichrist will arise from these ten nations, and his boastful mouth will seek to exalt himself as God. He will be destroyed only by a direct intervention of the Ancient of Days. The world has seen some awful dictators in its short history—Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, and others—but this world dictator will crush all opposition to his rule.

It’s good to be on the Lord’s side. We know the end from the beginning, and the good news is that we win!

"
12-01,12-01,335,"I am writing to you, my dear children, because your sins have been forgiven because of Jesus. ",1 John 2:12,"John designates three types of Christians, according to their maturity levels. His first exhortation is to the “dear children” whose entire experience and excitement revolves around the knowledge that their sins have been forgiven. Every new Christian needs to be taught and discipled in this simple truth. Unfortunately, most believers never fully enjoy the one basic fact that their sins have been forgiven on account of Jesus.

The second level of Christian maturity is the “young” (1 John 2:13). These Christians have moved into the level of spiritual warfare. They are strong in God’s Word and have overcome the devil (v. 14). They have allowed God to tear down the strongholds of Satan over their minds, bodies, and past struggles. They understand the truths of spiritual freedom from bondage and live in that freedom.

The last group is the “mature,” who know Christ (v. 13). These people, walking in close relationship with God, know Him as more than just Forgiver and Deliverer. They know God as Father in spiritual worship and intimacy.

Grow up, little one. Your Father has more of His goodness for you to enjoy."
12-02,12-02,336,"When the wicked take charge, people hide. When the wicked meet disaster, the godly multiply. ",Proverbs 28:28,"History is replete with stories of the rise and fall of persecutors of the Church, but the worst persecutor of all time could arrive in our generation. We may or may not be around when the actual Antichrist arrives on the scene, but the “spirit of the Antichrist” (1 John 4:3) has been working for thousands of years. It is a deceptive spirit, seeking to deny that Jesus is the Christ and thus denying the Father and the Son (2:22).

Daniel received the greatest Old Testament revelation of the Antichrist. He foresaw the covenant the Antichrist will make with the Jewish people in the seven years known as the Tribulation. The Antichrist will suddenly turn on the Jewish nation and “set up a sacrilegious object that causes desecration” (Daniel 9:27). It will be an image of the Antichrist himself in the midst of the Jews’ rebuilt temple.

We are not deceived, however, because we have the truth of the Holy Spirit living in us (1 John 2:20). Let us fear neither the literal Antichrist nor the spirit of Antichrist. The greater One is living inside us!"
12-03,12-03,337,"Dear children, don’t let anyone deceive you about this: When people do what is right, it is because they are righteous, even as Christ is righteous. But when people keep on sinning, it shows they belong to the Devil, who has been sinning since the beginning. But the Son of God came to destroy these works of the Devil. ",1 John 3:7-8,"Certain signs indicate to us that someone has truly been born again. The first sign is victory over areas of habitual sin: “Those who have been born into God’s family do not sin, because God’s life is in them. So they can’t keep on sinning, because they have been born of God” (1 John 3:9). True conversion does not mean sinless perfection. Rather, it means that a person has forsaken the habitual sins that once enslaved him.

The second sign of true conversion is love for one’s brothers: “If we love our Christian brothers and sisters, it proves that we have passed from death to eternal life. But a person who has no love is still dead” (v. 14). When we come to Christ, gone are all attitudes of hatred and prejudice.

The third sign of genuine conversion is generosity. Giving is directly connected to love, because love always manifests itself in giving. First John 3:17 tells us, “But if anyone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need and refuses to help—how can God’s love be in that person?” A hilarious, cheerful, sharing spirit is physical evidence of the new birth.

A final sign of the new birth is confidence before God for the things requested in prayer (vv. 21-22). The believer does not display a shy, hesitant faith, but a bold, confident position in grace.

Follow these four signs—they are sure to lead you to true believers!"
12-04,12-04,338,"Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God. For there are many false prophets in the world. ",1 John 4:1,"There is truth in the saying “All that glitters is not gold.” First John 4:1 warns us not to believe every spirit. Just as Satan can masquerade as an angel of light, so a person living for Satan can say the right words but live the wrong way.

Some false prophets speak very glibly and eloquently but oppose the very truth of God. Rejecting the fact that Jesus has come in the flesh, these prophets often refer to Him as a wonderful leader or a great teacher. In fact, most world religions recognize Christ as a great person.

The Holy Spirit will give you discernment and wisdom to spot indicators that are contrary to the Spirit of Jesus. Daniel said, “Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky, and those who turn many to righteousness will shine like stars forever” (Daniel 12:3). We must depend on the Holy Spirit, the One of whom John said, “The Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world”

(1 John 4:4).

Follow the Holy Spirit and godly pastoral authority. Be wise and discerning. Satan can’t hide forever, and the Lord knows how to keep you out of the enemy’s deceptive web."
12-05,12-05,339,"Evil people are trapped by sin, but the righteous escape, shouting for joy. ",Proverbs 29:6,"Satan is a master at setting traps for believers. He is called the “fowler” in Psalm 124:7 (KJV), that is, a person who traps birds. Perhaps as a child you watched someone take bread crumbs and make a trail that led inside a box. The box was propped up on a stick, and a string was tied to the stick. The fowler waited behind a fence or a building while an unsuspecting bird followed the bread crumbs into the box. Then, at just the right moment, the fowler pulled the string, and the bird was caught.

Do you know someone who is following “bread crumbs” right now? Little enticements toward money, sex, addictions, or positions come at just the right time to keep the person moving toward the “box.” Satan knows that if he can get someone who has no accountability to others to move down a sinful path, he can ultimately “pull the string,” and the unsuspecting person will be trapped.

Public embarrassment, loss of influence, and ultimately eternal death are Satan’s intentions as the fowler. By God’s grace, however, “we escaped like a bird from a hunter’s trap. The trap is broken, and we are free!” (Psalm 124:7)."
12-06,12-06,340,My people are being destroyed because they don’t know me. . . .,Hosea 4:6,"A story was once told of a couple who had won a free trip on a cruise ship. They never appeared with the others for the magnificent meals of steak and lobster. Instead, they ate every meal in their room, rationing out cheese and crackers they had brought with them. Someone asked them why they had not gone to the sumptuous feasts that were prepared for them daily. The man and his wife were utterly shocked to learn that the meals had been included in the price of the cruise!

How many Christians are living on spiritual “cheese and crackers” when they could be enjoying “steak and ice cream”? They simply lack the knowledge of what belongs to them in Christ. God, however, delights to see His children gain knowledge of their inheritance and then walk in that light. John said, “How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living in the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father” (2 John 1:4).

The other side, unfortunately, is represented by those who reject knowledge, as described in Hosea 4:6. They have been taught the truth and have rejected it in unbelief. Their lack of knowledge of God and His ways destroys them.

Come on down to the galley. The banquet table is spread for you!"
12-07,12-07,341,"When the Lord restored his exiles to Jerusalem, it was like a dream! We were filled with laughter, and we sang for joy. . . . ",Psalm 126:1-2,"Restoration is such a biblical idea. The Bible is full of stories of broken lives, wrecked dreams, and dashed hopes. But in these stories, the power of faith brings such a dramatic turnaround in each situation that the people involved cannot contain their emotions.

There may have been a situation you practically gave up on, but then God reversed it miraculously. Perhaps Psalm 126:2 describes how you and your loved ones felt as you laughed and joyfully sang aloud of the Lord’s deliverance.

Hosea 6:2 (NIV) describes a scene of two days of death and a third day of resurrection: “After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence.”  This is a direct prophecy of Jesus’ resurrection on the third day. His disciples had lost all hope, when suddenly He walked out of the grave!

Maybe today your hopes are lying dead inside the grave with Satan’s guards at the door. Take courage—the third day is coming! “Restore our fortunes, Lord, as streams renew the desert. Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy. They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest” (Psalm 126:4-6)."
12-08,12-08,342,"But you, dear friends, must continue to build your lives on the foundation of your holy faith. And continue to pray as you are directed by the Holy Spirit. ",Jude 20,"Major storms and hurricanes have what are called steering currents. These currents keep the storms moving in a certain direction. Without the steering currents, the storms would be far more dangerous than they are.

Your life also gets out of control if you lack spiritual steering currents. Jude reveals that the first steering current is praying in the Holy Spirit. This kind of praying builds up your inner man and keeps your faith strong.

The second spiritual guideline is living in God’s love. Jude says to

“live in such a way that God’s love can bless you as you wait for the eternal life that our Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy is going to give you” (v. 21). If you can continually stay in the center of the love of God, you will be able to wait patiently for God’s mercy to bring you to eternal life.

The third steering current is reaching out to others by obeying the command to “rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgment” (v. 23). To focus continually on soul winning will keep you off the reefs and rocks of life. All your energy will be directed toward what God loves: souls!

Prayer, love, and outreach will steer you well, even when the ship of your life seems to be off course. If you let these “steering currents” guide your life, one day you will stand before God “innocent of sin and with great joy” (v. 24)."
12-09,12-09,343,"When people do not accept divine guidance, they run wild. But whoever obeys the law is happy. ",Proverbs 29:18,"Natural reasoning always leads us off track. The more we think and reason about standards, morality, and righteousness, the more we excuse wrong behavior. What we need is revelation—God’s opinion and verdict about our actions. God did not give us the “Ten Suggestions.” He gave us the Ten Commandments!

The book of Revelation begins with this sentence: “This is a revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him concerning the events that will happen soon” (1:1). Each of the seven churches heard a direct word from Christ concerning putting their spiritual houses in order.

Joel saw a revelation of the end of time: “I will cause wonders in the heavens and on the earth—blood and fire and pillars of smoke. The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon will turn bloodred before that great and terrible day of the Lord arrives” (Joel 2:30-31). This awesome revelation and wonder will have an incredible effect, and “anyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (v. 32).

Live by revelation, not reasoning. One day you will be glad you did!"
12-10,12-10,344,"But always, first of all, I warn you through my servants the prophets. I, the Sovereign Lord, have now done this. ",Amos 3:7,"
In this verse God shows His desire to reveal His plans to His servants before events take place. God does not just spring events on nations. He gradually warns them of coming disaster, as He did in the case of Jonah and Nineveh.

The book of Revelation was written to seven different “angels” of the seven churches of Asia. Most commentators believe that these angels were the pastors of those churches. The local pastors received revelation from the Holy Spirit of God’s intention toward their churches.

In our churches today, if the pastor needs to repent, the Holy Spirit will convict the leader or use circumstances to force him to face an issue. This leading by the Holy Spirit protects the flock, since the local church will follow the leader in either the right or wrong direction.

If you are concerned about the direction of your church, pray for your pastor. God has obligated Himself to speak to him, so pray, asking the Lord to give your pastor the courage to obey as he hears God speaking.

"
12-11,12-11,345,"Write this letter to the angel of the church in Sardis. This is the message from the one who has the sevenfold Spirit of God and the seven stars: I know all the things you do, and that you have a reputation for being alive— but you are dead. ",Revelation 3:1,"The church in Sardis suffered from spiritual slumber. It’s easy for us to walk around and look spiritually correct when, in fact, our vital relationship with God is dead. The Lord said to the Sardis church, “Now wake up! Strengthen what little remains, for even what is left is at the point of death. Your deeds are far from right in the sight of God” (Revelation 3:2).

If we are not careful, sleep can sneak up on us, even at the wheel of a car. The psalmist said, “I long for the Lord more than sentries long for the dawn, yes, more than sentries long for the dawn” (Psalm 130:6). The watchman’s entire occupation is based upon staying awake, intently gazing at the darkness for any sign of the enemy. If he falls asleep, disastrous consequences can result for the entire city.

Instead of sleeping, the watchman eagerly looks to the eastern sky for signs of the morning sun. In the same way, our souls should have an eager expectation for God, a quickened excitement every time we spend time alone with Him.

Amos said, “How terrible it will be for you who lounge in luxury and think you are secure. . . .” (Amos 6:1). Stir yourself up, for the Lord “will come upon you suddenly, as unexpected as a thief” (Revelation 3:3)."
12-12,12-12,346,"Pride ends in humiliation, while humility brings honor. ",Proverbs 29:23,"Pride is undoubtedly the deadliest of sins. It caused the downfall of Satan, and for centuries he has deceived countless men and women.

David, the greatest king of Israel, would not allow pride in his life. He declared, “Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I don’t concern myself with matters too great or awesome for me” (Psalm 131:1). Associating with the wealthy, the intellectual, or political “movers and shakers” causes some to consider themselves exalted, as did Haman in the book of Esther.

David, however, was willing to associate with anyone and still remained secure in who he was. He reminded himself that his soul was as quiet as a “weaned child with its mother” (v. 2, NIV). Weaned children do not struggle for position and nourishment, but rather are relaxed and content to lie on their mothers’ laps. Prideful people, on the other hand, are always fidgety. They push for position and notoriety and work all the angles.

As though we were babies on God’s lap, let us relax and allow Him to exalt us. We will live longer and go further as well!"
12-13,12-13,347,"Then as I looked, I saw a door standing open in heaven, and the same voice I had heard before spoke to me with the sound of a mighty trumpet blast. The voice said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.” ",Revelation 4:1,"The fourth chapter of Revelation portrays an awesome scene. In this passage we get our first glimpse of heaven’s glorious landscape and beauty. Even though we know in our hearts that heaven is real, to have it described is breathtaking: “I saw a throne in heaven and someone sitting on it! The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones— jasper and carnelian. And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow” (vv. 2-3).

Rainbow colors of precious jewels were all around the throne of God. Before the throne were the twenty-four elders, the seven lamps of the Spirit of God, and the sea of glass. Four awesome creatures surrounded the throne, and day and night, they cry, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty—the one who always was, who is, and who is still to come” (v. 8).

The earthly ark of the covenant was just a little gold-plated box that symbolized this awesome throne. David’s heart’s desire was to build a place for that ark in Zion, for God had said, “This is my home where I will live forever. . . . I will live here, for this is the place I desired” (Psalm 132:14).

Make spending time in God’s presence the greatest desire of your life. One day your eyes will see Him face-to-face upon the throne of His glory."
12-14,12-14,348,"How wonderful it is, how pleasant, when brothers live together in harmony! For harmony is as precious as the fragrant anointing oil that was poured over Aaron’s head, that ran down his beard and onto the border of his robe. ",Psalm 133:1-2,"Harmony is a state that many try to achieve, but few can maintain. A man without God will find himself continually disagreeing, fighting, and pushing for position. The psalmist, however, beautifully expressed the wonder of people working and walking together in one accord.

Harmony is not uniformity, as we all possess different outlooks, backgrounds, and gifts. Harmony is a choice to sacrifice one’s personal agenda for the greater good of the “team,” whether that team is a family, ministry, or organization. Harmony generates the same precious fragrance as the oil that ran from Aaron’s head onto his robe. It is as refreshing as the crystal waters that flowed from snowcapped Mount Hermon to the valley below (Psalm 133:3).

Whenever the leaders come into harmony, or unity, the followers who are under them will unify as well. Let us accept the great challenge of Christ’s prayer in John 17 and lay aside our personal king-dom-building in order that we may promote and help the whole Body. One day we will join the hundreds of millions around the throne, as we all sing in harmony, “The Lamb is worthy” (Revelation 5:12)."
12-15,12-15,349,"And they cried to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great day of their wrath has come, and who will be able to survive?” ",Revelation 6:16-17,"The beauty of the opening scenes of Revelation gives way to the awful scenes of judgment upon the earth. God is merciful and long-suffering, but He will not be mocked. Earth is a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode with God’s fury and judgment upon the centuries-old wickedness in the nations of the world.

Step by step, plague by plague, the judgment of God will be poured out upon the earth. The fear of God’s wrath will fall upon all human beings to the point where mountains and rocks falling upon them will seem like a welcome relief!

The writer of Proverbs questioned, “Who but God goes up to heaven and comes back down? Who holds the wind in his fists? Who wraps up the oceans in his cloak? Who has created the whole wide world? What is his name—and his son’s name? Tell me if you know!” (30:4).

Fear the One who sits on the throne and His Son, the Lamb. Fear the Lord now while you may still receive His grace and forgiveness!"
12-16,12-16,350,"As for me, I look to the Lord for his help. I wait confidently for God to save me, and my God will certainly hear me. Do not gloat over me, my enemies! For though I fall, I will rise again. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord himself will be my light. ",Micah 7:7-8,"Sometimes it seems as though you wait forever for a breakthrough. Satan laughs and mocks your faith, insisting that you are waiting in vain. Micah’s response to Satan’s jabs was a strong confession of faith. Confident that the Lord would save him, Micah declared that although he might be down, he was not out!

When going through periods of waiting for God, hours turn into days, weeks, and months. Satan’s taunts and jeers ring in your ears. Through it all, however, remember that one day the tables will turn. You may have fallen, but you must boldly declare, “I will arise.” You may be sitting in darkness now, but one day the Lord will light all the darkness around you!

The elders around the throne of God reminded John, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white” (Revelation 7:14). Are you going through a period of tribulation and waiting for God to act? Stand forever, if necessary, for Satan knows that one day “God will wipe away all [your] tears” (v. 17)."
12-17,12-17,351,"Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good! His faithful love endures forever. ",Psalm 136:1,"The twenty-six letters of the Hebrew alphabet are used to begin the twenty-six verses of Psalm 136. Twenty-six times the Holy Spirit wants us to know that “His faithful loves endures forever.” This fact should be branded upon our minds and hearts both now and always.

In stark contrast to this message is the incredible judgment of the seventh seal (Revelation 8). Death, darkness, and despair consume the earth with fiery hail, falling stars, and bitter waters. How does this judgment show a God whose love endures forever? Nahum provides the answer: “The Lord is slow to get angry, but his power is great, and he never lets the guilty go unpunished. He displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm. The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet” (Nahum 1:3). God shows His love by waiting so long to impose judgment!

Centuries have gone by with God’s long-suffering, restraining judgment being withheld, just as He withheld in the days of Noah. God also waited patiently for Pharaoh, though He “killed the firstborn of Egypt” (Psalm 136:10). The old idea that a God of love cannot show wrath is wrong. His love is shown by the fact that He waits so long to display His wrath!"
12-18,12-18,352,"Even though the fig trees have no blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vine; even though the olive crop fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will rejoice in the Lord! I will be joyful in the God of my salvation. ",Habakkuk 3:17-18,"Joy is the biggest prize Satan could ever steal from a Christian. Someone once said, “If he can steal your joy, he can spoil your goods.” The prophet Habakkuk knew how important it was to keep his joy, and he was determined to hold on to it tightly, even in the most difficult of circumstances.

Joy is the one precious commodity Satan cannot take from you unless you give it to him. When you have your joy, you will say with Habakkuk, “The Sovereign Lord is my strength! He will make me as sure-footed as a deer and bring me safely over the mountains” (Habakkuk 3:19). The little deer’s feet are so nimble that even when he is knocked from a towering precipice, he still lands on his feet. With joy in your heart, you will always land on your feet, no matter the trial.

Perhaps you can rejoice when everything is going perfectly, but what about when the bank balance is zero and all your efforts seem to be unfruitful? Purpose today to “always be joyful. Keep on praying. No matter what happens, always be thankful, for this is God’s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:16).

Rejoice!"
12-19,12-19,353,"When I pray, you answer me; you encourage me by giving me the strength I need. ",Psalm 138:3,"Trials and troubles tend to make us fearful. Instead of feeling stout and bold, we feel stooped and cold! However, Zephaniah 3:17 reminds us, “For the Lord your God has arrived to live among you. He is a mighty savior. He will rejoice over you with great gladness. With his love, he will calm all your fears. He will exult over you by singing a happy song.” This is your first secret to recovery: God is with you! Having Him on your side is like having the United States Army on your side in a skirmish with a Boy Scout troop!

Next, He will rejoice over you with gladness. All His attention and loving affection is directed toward you in the same way a father directs his attention toward his son.

Then, He will calm all your fears. Your fearful, timid whining is for nothing, because perfect love casts out fear (1 John 4:18). You can rest contented and safe in His arms.

Finally, He exults over you by singing a happy song. This picture is like that of a parent holding a child and singing to him in his darkest hour. Can you imagine God singing songs of deliverance over you? What enemy has a chance against such odds?

Be bold and strong, for your Father is on the scene."
12-20,12-20,354,"The leech has two suckers that cry out, “More, more!” There are three others things—no, four!—that are never satisfied: the grave, the barren womb, the thirsty desert, the blazing fire. ",Proverbs 30:15,"Some people are perpetual takers and not givers. Their attitude is that anyone and everyone owe them something, and their sour, stingy snarls are flashed at those who don’t oblige them.

Often the selfishness of such people leads to God’s rebuke. The prophet Haggai addressed those who pursued only the building of their own houses and not God’s house. He said, “This is what the Lord Almighty says: Consider how things are going for you! You have planted much but harvested little. You have food to eat, but not enough to fill you up. You have wine to drink, but not enough to satisfy your thirst. You have clothing to wear, but not enough to keep you warm. Your wages disappear as though you were putting them in pockets filled with holes!” (Haggai 1:5-6). God had to withhold His blessing from His people in order to teach them that His kingdom came first.

Giving to a “leech” who is opposed to God’s kingdom and who is only a “taker” is a hopeless cause. Such a person will never prosper. Someone once said, “If it rubs you the wrong way, turn the cat around!” Become a giver and watch God seal up the holes in your pockets."
12-21,12-21,355,"Suddenly, I witnessed in heaven another significant event. I saw a large red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, with seven crowns on his heads. His tail dragged down one-third of the stars, which he threw to the earth. He stood before the woman as she was about to give birth to her child, ready to devour the baby as soon as it was born. ",Revelation 12:3-4,"The dragon spoken of in Revelation 12 is ever on the prowl. Though there may be disagreement over the identities of the woman and the child, Satan’s identity as the dragon is clear. Cast from the heavenly realms with his angels, He will inhabit only the earth and the sea, and in fury he will seek all God-fearing people for “he knows that he has little time” (Revelation 12:12).

The psalmist saw this dragon also. He pleaded, “O Lord, rescue me from evil people. Preserve me from those who are violent, those who plot evil in their hearts and stir up trouble all day long. Their tongues sting like a snake; the poison of a viper drips from their lips” (Psalm 140:1-3).

Revelation 12:10-11 reveals that we have three weapons in our arsenal with which to fight the dragon. First, “the Accuser has been thrown down to earth” (v. 10). We are no longer under guilt and condemnation, and we do not have to listen to the devil’s accusations against us.

Second, they “defeated him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of their testimony” (v. 11). In the precious blood of Jesus and with the testimony of His saving grace, we have a mighty weapon to wield against the dragon.

Finally, “they were not afraid to die” (v. 11). You cannot truly kill someone who has already been crucified with Christ.

“Rejoice, O heavens! ” (Revelation 12:12). Our enemy is destined for defeat!"
12-22,12-22,356,"Keep me out of the traps they have set for me, out of the snares of those who do evil. ",Psalm 141:9,"Many of David’s prayers were encompassed in two words: Keep me!

The role of Protector is one of God’s most glorious attributes. He promised Zechariah two forms of protection. First, He promised to be “a wall of fire around Jerusalem” (Zechariah 2:5). Even wild animals fear fire, and God said that He would erect around us a wall of flaming fire that no enemy could penetrate.

God also promised Zechariah that “he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of [my] eye” (v. 8 KJV). The apple may be interpreted as the “pupil” of the eye. It is the gate, the very center of the eyeball, through which all light must pass. The eyeball is fiercely protected by the eyelid, which instinctively closes the moment anything threatening comes near the eye. In effect, the Lord is saying, “I am not only watching over you, but you are in my eye!”

If you walk closely to the Lord, you will never stray outside His “wall of fire,” and you will always be protected as the “pupil of His eye.” Fear not, citizen of Zion. Your God has awesome keeping power!"
12-23,12-23,357,"Then he said to me, “This is what the Lord says to Zerubbabel: It is not by force nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the Lord Almighty.” ",Zechariah 4:6,"How easy it is to despise our efforts in the Lord! Of course, Satan is always there to point out that what we are doing is insignificant. We react by trying harder to bring our plans to perfection. Ultimately, however, our energy will lag, and we will have to admit that we can do nothing in our own strength. It takes the Spirit of the Lord to accomplish anything of value.

Why should we labor alone in our own strength when God’s Spirit will work alongside us? We must learn to rely on the supernatural. “Nothing, not even a mighty mountain, will stand in Zerubbabel’s way; it will flatten out before him! Then Zerubbabel will set the final stone of the Temple in place, and the people will shout: ‘May God bless it! May God bless it!’ ” (Zechariah 4:7).

Who would have thought that a mountain could come down just by shouting at it? The walls of Jericho, like Zerubbabel’s mountain, did not come down by man’s reasoning, but by God’s power. Satan may belittle our praises, but he knows that praise is our mightiest weapon in the arsenal of faith. Keep shouting at your mountain—the Holy Spirit will bring it down!"
12-24,12-24,358,"There are four things on earth that are small but unusually wise: Ants—they aren’t strong, but they store up food for the winter. Rock badgers—they aren’t powerful, but they make their homes among the rocky cliffs. Locusts—they have no king, but they march like an army in ranks. Lizards—they are easy to catch, but they are found even in kings’ palaces. ",Proverbs 30:24-28,"The writer of Proverbs describes four creatures that are tiny, but smart. These creatures can be understood in the context of the four aspects of evangelism.

The ant has tremendous drive to gather food during the harvest season. In the same way, we must have an urgency, or purpose, as we sense the shortness of time left for reaping the souls of humanity.

The rock badger finds its strength in the rocks in which it lives. We also will find greater evangelistic productivity when we are in partnership with other stronger believers.

Net fishing with others is better than hook fishing alone! The locust flies together with other locusts, ruling the air and even blacking out the sun. No evangelism would be fruitful without concerted prayer with others that takes control of the heavenlies.

Finally, the lizard has a real knack of penetration. It can make its way into all kinds of places, even a king’s palace. We must be unafraid to go through any open door and prepared to crawl through any evangelism “crack” the Lord opens before us.

Proverbs 11:30 (KJV) says, “He that winneth souls is wise.” Rescuing eternal souls requires great wisdom, and that wisdom involves purpose, partnership, prayer, and penetration. Ask the Lord today for this wisdom, and start fulfilling your eternal destiny!"
12-25,12-25,359,. . . Happy indeed are those whose God is the Lord. ,Psalm 144:15,"We are, indeed, happy and blessed! On this Christmas Day in which our Lord’s birth is traditionally celebrated, we should take time to remember our blessings.

First, we can thank God for His blessings upon our children. How grateful we are that “our sons flourish in their youth like well-nurtured plants. . . . Our daughters [are] like graceful pillars, carved to beautify a palace” (Psalm 144:12). To have well-mannered, God-fearing children is such a great blessing.

Because of the blessing of provision, “our farms [are] filled with crops of every kind,” and “the flocks in our fields multiply by the thousands” (v. 13). God’s material blessings to His people are bounteous!

Because of our God, we are privileged to live in a land of peace. There are “no breached walls, no forced exile, no cries of distress in our squares” (v.14). We should never take for granted the peace in our families, on our streets, in our churches, and in our government. In spite of all our problems in America, we are still privileged to “live in peace and quietness, in godliness and dignity” (1 Timothy 2:2).

“Yes, happy are those who have it like this! Happy indeed are those whose God is the Lord” (Psalm 144:15). I trust this can be said of you and of me!"
12-26,12-26,360,"Rejoice greatly, O people of Zion! Shout in triumph, O people of Jerusalem! Look, your king is coming to you. He is righteous and victorious, yet he is humble, riding on a donkey—even on a donkey’s colt. ",Zechariah 9:9,"With amazing accuracy, Zechariah looked down the corridor of time and described Jesus Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Without the Holy Spirit, how could Zechariah have possibly known that one day Christ would indeed be riding on a little donkey, with thousands of adoring worshipers shouting and laying palm branches in the road? Matthew was an eyewitness of this exact scene and quoted Zechariah, the prophet who had predicted it (Matthew 21:5).

There are sixty-one direct prophecies such as this one, which had to be fulfilled in perfect sequence for Jesus to fulfill all the Old Testament predictions of the Messiah. According to renowned mathematician and scientist Peter Stoner, if the prophets had concocted in their own wisdom only eight prophecies, the odds of having all eight come true in any one person would be the same as the odds of someone who is blindfolded finding—on his first try—a marked silver dollar in the state of Texas, with the entire state buried two feet deep in silver dollars!

Let’s bow today, not before the babe in the manger, but before the mighty King who “will bring peace to the nations” (Zechariah 9:10)!"
12-27,12-27,361,"And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potters”— this magnificent sum at which they valued me! So I took the thirty coins and threw them to the potters in the Temple of the Lord. ",Zechariah 11:13,"Another amazing prophecy of Zechariah had to do with Christ’s betrayal. Judas fulfilled this prophecy immediately after his betrayal of Jesus. “Then Judas threw the money onto the floor of the Temple and went out and hanged himself. . . . After some discussion [the priests] finally decided to buy the potter’s field, and they made it into a cemetery for foreigners. That is why the field is still called the Field of Blood” (Matthew 27:5, 7-8).

Money is so tempting, yet so unfulfilling. Those thirty pieces of silver seemed worth the entire world to Judas until they were actually in his hand. Then they became like garbage to him. How Satan had twisted Judas’s mind to value something that would cost him his life!

The great city of Babylon is the symbol of the materialistic god of this world, and it will be smashed to pieces in just one moment of time (Revelation 18:10). Christ is the “pearl of great value” (Matthew 13:46), and nothing else in this world really matters.

Let us hold Him dear and exchange nothing for His love."
12-28,12-28,362,"Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. And the one sitting on the horse was named Faithful and True. For he judges fairly and then goes to war. ",Revelation 19:11,"Jesus shines through the ends of both the Old and New Testaments. John saw Him in His glorious, visible return. Zechariah prophesied of the reaction of the Jewish people at the Lord’s return:

“They will look on me whom they have pierced and mourn for him as for an only son. They will grieve bitterly for him as for a firstborn son who has died” (Zechariah 12:10).

Zechariah saw the Jewish nation returning to God through the covenant blood that was shed for all humankind. “On that day a fountain will be opened for the dynasty of David and for the people of Jerusalem, a fountain to cleanse them from all their sins and defilement”

(13:1). He saw the spirit of repentance poured out on Israel as they asked the Lord Jesus, “Then what are those scars on your chest?” (v. 6). He will reply, “I was wounded at the home of friends!” (v. 6).

Christ, the marvelous Redeemer, will return one day, and every eye will see Him. Are you ready for that return?"
12-29,12-29,363,"On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives will split apart, making a wide valley running from east to west, for half the mountain will move toward the north and half toward the south. ",Zechariah 14:4,"The final battle at Jerusalem will be ended by the visible return of Christ. He will descend to the same spot on earth from which He ascended: the Mount of Olives. When His feet touch the earth, the mountain will split, and a river will be opened between the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean.

Jesus’ coming will usher in the Millennium, a thousand-year reign of peace on earth administrated by Christ Jesus Himself. Satan will be bound for a thousand years and will not be allowed to “deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years [are] finished” (Revelation 20:3). The Tribulation martyrs will be raised from the dead to join believers in reigning with Christ.

In your darkest hour, remember: The Prince of Peace is on His way!"
12-30,12-30,364,"And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven like a beautiful bride prepared for her husband. ",Revelation 21:2,"The bride spoken of in Revelation 21:2 provides us with an appropriate description of the city of the New Jerusalem, filled with the faithful believers in Christ. All history closes with a description of the marriage of Christ to His Church, an eternal romance in which believers will be in covenant with Him forever.

This description of the Bride of Christ is, in fact, a picture of a godly marriage. It symbolizes a covenant of faithfulness and commitment so that all the world may see how Christ will care for His Church. For this reason, God declared his hatred of divorce (Malachi 2:16), as it destroys the beautiful picture of covenant faithfulness.

Proverbs 31:10-24 describes “a virtuous and capable wife.” Her beauty, grace, wisdom, and faithfulness, as well as her relationship with her offspring and husband, all portray the qualities of the Bride of Christ. All that God is working in your life is designed to prepare you to be married to Christ forever. One day, the Holy Spirit will usher the Church to the gate of heaven and then march her down the main street of the New Jerusalem to be married to Christ.

Get ready, Bride of Christ. Your greatest day is approaching!"
12-31,12-31,365,"“Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my Temple. If you do,” says the Lord Almighty, “I will open the windows of heaven for you. I will pour out a blessing so great you won’t have enough room to take it in! Try it! Let me prove it to you!” ",Malachi 3:10,"As we end this year and begin the new, we remember the promises of God concerning tithes and offerings. The tithe, or tenth, was instituted by God to remind us that we are just passing through this world on our way to an eternal city. The tithe of our income is holy money, and withholding it from the Lord actually means we are robbing Him (Malachi 3:8). How significant is a tenth of the tiny income we receive on earth when compared to the glories to come?

Some of these future glories include “a pure river with the water of life . . . a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, with a fresh crop each month,” and a city where “there will be no night . . . for the Lord God will shine on them” (Revelation 22:1-2, 5).

As you begin a new year, put your priorities in order. Give God His holy tenth. Remember: You are getting ready for eternal, heavenly blessings that are so great you will never be able to contain them all!"
